i wish him luck but what can he do at this point these big tech giants are way more powerful and influential parler by comparison is the ultimate underdog,1
if twitter can do anything because they are a private company then the rest of business can be open and do what they w,1
not a wise course of action these corporations are behemoths and can afford to tie up parler in law fare for years he should focus on finding new servers and then working on a long term solution to this deplatforming threat,1
idk why you all think this is a cut and dry issue with an obvious answer plus i thought you all stood for small government and allowing corporations to choose who they do business with i mean fuck if you guys aren t then i m on the wrong subreddit this subreddit is r conservative not r donaldtrump or even r republican have some god damn standards if you were of the opinion that the wedding cake business owners should not be forced to serve that gay couple but you re for the government stepping in here you re a hypocrite same goes for the opposite case in r polit,1
1 stop buying apple they do not let you side load 2 do not panic you can use the parler website if the pirate bay can get hosting so can parler 3 this is good because the more it happens the more people leave big tech 4 the more control big tech exerts over distribution the less they control distribution 4 do not give up your principle that you can decide who your customers ar,1
there was a thing a little while back where poland would fine social media platforms for political censorship,1
i mean this is coordinated anticompetitive behavior that just screams antitrust,1
i just talked to a friend of mine who thinks there is absolutely nothing wrong with what big tech is doing he also defended the riots all last year but is now saying the right is out of control i am genuinely confused how people can support this stuff what a tim,1
i would really love to download parler except for them forcing me to give them my telephone number i will sit here in silence with my privacy more intact,1
time to decentralize redevelop to host on decentralized platforms use the technology storj sia use they cannot shit down all of is besides a social media platform that doesn t spy on user activity is a threat to big tech,1
on what grounds our leftist tech overlords write the terms and condit,1
strongest case that i have not heard anyone say yet is a tortious interference claim,1
surely someone with money in america still has principles and cares about free speech right,1
companies like apple et al have nearly infinite monies and legions of lawyers to fight this type of suit i hope parler prevail but somehow i think they will go bankrupt before they even see the inside of a courtroom,1
has anyone seen proof of parler being directly responsible for the storming of the capitol we keep seeing how they are a collection of hate groups gathering yet i ve yet to see any posts indicating they engage in nazism seems to me they are the perfect scapegoat for all this violence just because trump has been banned from twitter if i get banned from all social media so be it i grew up in the 80s and 90s and got along great without it i can live without people knowing my every waking thought and opinion too bad not everyone can say the sam,1
there is no denying it was a coordinated attack on such a fast schedule as to prevent any chance of them stopping it,1
yeah i am sure a white guy who runs a free speech website is going to be treated 100 fairly by the legal system and win a major landmark case lol we are not living in reality here he is a second class citizen from a global and newly landless microminority and his filings will be laughed at,1
i feel bad for him this is pissing me off way more than twitter banning people i feel like this is very anti competetive behavior they basicly have a monopoly on social media,1
as long as he stays humble and open to free discussion on his platform he will be insanely wealthy in no tim,1
best of luck to them the tech companies are so powerful and they have the government aka the party on their side i wish them the best,1
it is unbelievably hypocritical that google twitter and facebook benefit so much from and fight so hard to preserve the legal protection from being held liable for what users post on their platforms and then turn around and pull this shit on their competitors in what world could it be legal for them to act like this it is clear and objective anti trust violations google is a vertical monopoly and is abusing this to remain a horizontal monopoly time for some good old fashioned trust bust,1
that should take wait a minute a decad,1
big tech has censored and banned the actual president of the united fucking states of america look i am all for the rights of private companies to do as they please but when these companies grow to the size and scope of utilities its changes the game a little what if the power companies could deny service to people they did not like they cannot these huge media companies like apple facebook twitter google etc they function almost as utilities at this point and being unable to use them is a crazy blow to any company that relies on their services this whole thing is nut,1
what a shame it is astonishing how the left celebrates censorship what has this country come to i hope parler finds its way back in the app store or someth,1
racketeering and anti trust hoooooooo this is the bed you made leftists say goodbye to your indoctrination platform,1

i am slamming amazons chat line this morning with shit and will continue to do so hope others will consider doing the sam,1
this is only going to piss more people off,1
it is crazy as shit to me that we have one side of the great political divide that is just a okay with completely undermining free speech so political opinions they disagree with are silenced like i cannot stand the bullshit some liberals say but i would fight for their right to say it what the fuck is happening to our country where does this madness stop,1
collision amongst the monopoly play,1
i hate parler and it is dumb i fully fully support this and hope we can open up the internet as a utility fuck these censoring scumbags making the same jim crow era arguments to ban people they dislike from modern life on the internet shit i would be a card carrying aclu member if they supported gun right,1
its technofascism and racketeering twitter google amazon and apple are colluding to forcibly shut down businesses that compete with them,1
if gays can force you to make them a wedding cake then conservatives can force you to host their app as long as nothing on it is illegal edit oh you ninnies do not like the use of the word gays because you are afraid it is offensive so i get downvotes well i have had plenty of gay sex in my life so i am talking about myself and i am free to do that you sjws punks my point stands and it is a good one the legal argument works the sam,1
it is gonna get interesting i think the problem lies in the ubiquity of platforms like twitter and facebook and their uniform rejection of people on the right yet they retain a casual disregard for anything that might be akin to incitement on the left can you imagine investing your time and resources in an app and then being told your app can be of no use because too many people might have voted for trump that use it if the personal and political get so wedded it will not be pleasant for anybody in the middl,1
that is good to hear,1

i hope it s another sandman level win,1
he has a couple items he probably has a chance with first the coordination is obvious and it is extremely anti competitive second that they made press releases about it publicly this is blacklisting of a form and i have not read the press releases themselves but could be an area of trouble for big tech,1
well it s time to use it against them portray them as the larry of censorship then they try to go to conservative sites ban them get a movement going to break up the monopolies dump amazon facebook ig and others actively campaigns against them,1

those morons keep denying that this is censorship completely forgetting that corporate censorship is a thing it is strange because usually those on the left are highly concerned with the amount of power massive corporations have over the public you would think they would be appalled and yet they are applauding it,1

their mods probably do too seeing as they perma ban conservatives for being conservative it is impressive how they manage to run their sub even worse than rpolitics they used to be a pretty neutral community not sure if the current pos mods are new or if they just could not handle that the sub did not represent their vision of how people should think,1
it is natural for authoritarians they do not care what happens or how many rights they lose as long as the authortarians crush their political rivals first they could be told that they will be getting shot tomorrow and would happily agree with it if it meant they get to watch their enemies shot today,1

if microsoft can be sued for stifling netscape then then i don t see why apple google and amazon can t be sued for shutting down parler i haven t seen anything on parler as bad as what i ve seen on twitter https en m wikipedia org wiki united_states_v _microsoft_corp,1
it is protected by the same laws that twitter and facebook take advantage of so naturally we get to watch the democrats strip away at 230 protections to get rid of parler which will in turn put checks on twitter and facebook,1
remov,1
it is less a twitter can do what they want and more of a the government cannot tell companies how to regulate political speech under current law issue corporations like twitter can be regulated but not in ways that infringe on their constitutional rights the courts have ruled that shutting down businesses for legitimate public safety concerns is constitutional although it is up to the government to prove that there are legitimate public safety concerns and that their actions are not discriminatory in other words this issue requires a legislative solution the courts really cannot do anything and we should not aspire to rule by judicial or executive fiat anyway,1

probably anti trust that twitter directly worked with apple and microsoft to de platform its leading competitor,1
on what grounds our leftist tech overlords write the terms and conditions worth mentioning terms and conditions do not supersede the law these tech companies have a habit of putting lots of illegal and unenforceable crap in their terms and conditions that would never stand up in court look at the various articles about warranty stickers on video game consoles for an example of this these companies just bank on the fact nobody will challenge them,1
when they block you at every turn it is hard and if you want to depend on the courts that is slow and already shown to be so easy to coerced ie sotus into the lefts path of takeov,1

of course not its just a general fascist attack on any opposing free speech made against the demlefty miscreants and their coup power grab,1
it s social media and an easy target,1
i mean yes but that argument would not hold up in a court,1
that in itself will convince so many people of this fundamental change that obama said and biden co are going to afflict america with is something to fight and undo all of it,1
you seem to believe that people value freedom much more than their voting history and the policy the support would suggest,1
do you know the term for marrying the government and corporations that they are essentially one body and not separated i do it is called fascism and it is literally what the left accuses of anyone els,1
they have committed suicide longterm 1 after the coming constitution restoring revolution the sane people wont trust these collaborator companies ever again trust bust breakup at minimum too 2 and the leftists will seize control of them as they always do and put who they want in charge to further their atrocities against freedom so these company dolts cant win either way,1
it will be the lefts destruction america will vomit them out,1
excuse my pessimism but if the supreme court didn t do anything about the election then they definitely won t help parl,1

more accurately it s sherman act they re shutting down one company customer parler by claiming terms of service violation while letting another twitter violate those same terms there is violent rhetoric on both sides planning and coordination of protests on both sides you can t have one without the other you can t say one is x and the other isn t it s conspiracy to create a monopoly for twitter by colluding to shut down their competit,1
it s sad how they seem to not think social media companies and big tech wouldn t be operating in the exact same manner against left leaning groups if the incoming government was majority conservative and blamed their platforms for allowing a violent act on the capitol yes it s extra convenient for big tech because they do politically align with the left but their first mission is to remain in their overwhelmingly powerful monopoly too big to fail status at all costs whenever there is the threat of possible legislation actual updating anti trust competition law to be better in regards to the digital economy etc they will do whatever they can to be seen as being on the right side of things it s extra ironic that the they are private companies and can do what they want line is being used by the left here on reddit who decry that free market capitalism every chance they get but this is far from a free market take parler for example it s not tens of millions of americans boycotting them because they actually did something bad that s causing their collapse they aren t failing because of legitimate legal enforcement for breaking the law they literally went from being one of the most downloaded applications in the planet to overnight not existing because less than a dozen tech companies that provide the cloud and servicing infrastructure needed to exist colluded to kill the competition of their friends over at twitter and facebook that should terrify everyon,1

at the same time they are thinking they are anti establishment it is funny to se,1
they are genuinely stupid enough that they do not realize that their entire political party is made up of and relies on massive corporations they still think the democrats are the party of the little guy the average working class american could not be further from the truth the people running their party are a bunch of rich ceos and politicians who have made a fortune through backdoor deals they do not see it as censorship because they think big tech is just cleaning out the racists domestic terrorists and bigots you have to realize the left indoctrinates their followers to think of anyone who disagrees with them as subhuman to them what big tech is doing to us is the same as taking out the trash or stepping on a bug,1

the problem is that if nobody does anything they ll do it again and right here is a perfect moment to strike back against these assholes would be nice to see fox lend them some good lawyers and support seeing as the left is already feeling emboldened by their recent war on free speech and have clearly set their sights on fox as their next target it is kind of like the statue debate last summer regardless of how people felt about the statues themselves smart people knew that going after the statues of confederate generals was merely a stepping stone to removing the founding fathers fast forward a few months and that is exactly what they started doing fox might have pissed a lot of people off the last few months but it is a safe bet they can see the writing on on the wall for what these left wing totalitarians are plan,1

they only care about anything when it is adverse for them but cheer it when it is to hurt who they perceive as their enemy zero principles first have a certain viewpoint then use whatever to confirm that bias if they gave an ounce of fuck about police brutality they would have cheered on thomas massies justin amashs bill to end qualified immunity and rand pauls to end no knock raids they could not care less it was all an excuse not a reason to create chaos and distract fuck over any remnants of small business that somehow survived the lockdown,1

funny that you have so many upvotes they can t downvote fast enough i love it when leftards get trigg,1
i am pretty sure antifa used facebook to coordinate their own terroristic riots these people do not care about consistency they only care about silencing those they disagree with,1
they do not politically align with the left only with themselves if the right offered them new legislation that would screw their competition harder than the lefts censorship and taxation they would be right wing all facebook cares about is preventing a facebook from rising up against their myspace all microsoft wants is to squash any microsoft before it threatens their ibm and so on,1

they actually made a statement about how this kind of censorship is dangerous and could backfire and be used against poc it was kind of dumb but they had the spirit so close enough,1
they are pretty libertarian but more left leaning beltway libertarians who align with democrats they are still pretty based on government free speech restriction and nat sec issues thing is this is not really a first amendment issue as much as a corporate regulatory issue so they would not be interest,1
they always have been,1
they would have to make the valid but difficult argument that political operatives in the democratic party have made an end run around constitutional rights by having closely politically aligned big tech destroy political opposition and corporate competition these entities are acting as state actors by proxi,1
parler is either turning itself into a martyr or it is david vs goliath what needs to be done is that a class action lawsuit needs to be filed fuck these tech fascists first the government destroys thousands of businesses with lockdowns and now the beneficiaries of the lockdowns are destroying their smaller competitor,1
the tech companies are going to get the jack ma treatment from the government at some point but it will be too late by then,1
i don t think so either i imagine amazon would have a clause in their contract giving them the right to terminate the service if certain conditions are met they d merely argue in court that they had been met and gave fair warning of the cancellation if it is a civil lawsuit and they can prove that amazon targeted them for political reasons they could sue for damages this is not about someone getting ripped off with a bad product for service this is literally destroying a private business just because they allow free speech sure they probably will not win but they have to do something this could open the door for a class action lawsuit filed by other companies that have been effecticely canceled by companies that have near monopolies in large sections of the tech markets hopefully some whistleblowers can come forward amazon could be engaging in illegal activities based on rico law,1
you realize the last major anti trust action to succeed was the blocking of staples and officemax merger because antitrust law was last updates decades ago and really pertains more towards brick and mortar and physical goods operations and is 100 not up to date to deal with modern antitrust issues in our digital economy staples and officemax if you don t remember we re trying to merge after losing nearly all of their market share to amazon and walmart online a merger would have saved a few thousand jobs i think but the doj blocked it because they d have a monopoly of office supply stores despite the fact that combined they were still less than like 20 of total sales in this area and even the direct to office wholesale market was smaller than amazon s and walmart ,1

with regards to what you are saying the government has put its paws unfairly on these matters previously so many of these companies get platform protections but do not operate under the guidelines of being platforms the playing field is not level because of government involvement in a perfect world small government would be the answer and people would be able to make their own opinions however when the government regulates isps to the point that starting a new company is nigh impossible and all of the tech sector collectively colludes against free speech you get conservatives asking for government intervention in the messes they cr,1

so the village idiot comes and posts derp all day spamming the entire system there should be no censorship i have been in many forums long in the past where there was real discussion from many sides but you might notice that isnt happening all that much these days and the intentional shitposts obscure anything of value again as intended moderators cannot keep up oif they are supposed to maintain order someone who actually explains their position likely would find a place unfortunately we know have a generation of people addicted to spewing one liners that now have to be dealt with,1

it s because of the flaired users only flair under the post if you aren t flaired your comment gets delet,1
if they did not this place would mirror r politics they vastly outnumber us they would try to take us over and you would never see a conservative post because they would bury it with downvotes libs lefties love censorship,1

i am waiting for twitter to just ban itself at this point the rules they have put forward means the entire platform will eventually ban itself,1
another how 2021 is more like 1984 than 1984,1
that will be the new excuse anything posted that makes leftism look bad will be considered inciting violence this comes from our college culture where we teach kids that words that hurt your feelings are a form of violence even if the words you post are their own,1

i have interviewed people who worked on the facebook policy team and left to other pastures they are very very very underqualified individuals who were hired straight out of college most of them as i understand it are either in the us on a temporary work visa from another country such as india or turkey or are located in dense offices of contract workers in these low cost countries the people judging the speech of americans are not very familiar with the standards this country was founded on,1

i have come to some conclusions about the difference between the left and the right after seeing how things have been playing out with recent events the right reacts to situations logically the left reacts to situations emotionally this is why the right reacts to the blm riots and the capital hill riots in the same way by condemning rioting and the left reacts emotionally they agree with the sentiments of the blm rioters and make endless justifications for them while overreacting in their condemnation of the capital hill riots this is why the left often appear so hypocritical they dont have a set of ideals or principles they stick to this is why you can take tweets from aoc from over the summer try and put them in the context of what is happening currently and end up with her looking like an idiot,1

the people judging the speech of americans are not very familiar with the standards this country was founded on i have always found it amusing going through border control or immigration and the person deciding whether i can enter a western country speaks less english than i do,1

has any of the ops of that hashtag been permanently banned yet,1
they are not really complaining although the article is so short it barely qualifies as an article it is pointing out the hypocrisy that twitter has bannable content trending that immediately gets removed by other social media sites yet twitter allows the content long enough and unchecked for it to hit their trending section which is pretty rich considering that the same complaint is why the major tech companies decided to try and delete parl,1
while receiving benefits and protections of a platform,1
yes but we live in a time when these independent tech companies can literally erase someone from existence with no oversight at all into what warrants the erasure it is time to regulate all tech social media platform,1
there are legal issues about whether they would be protected from liability under section 230 since they are just a platform but they are actually like a publisher either way they are being criticized for hypocrisy and double standards i do not see how them being private companies shields them from criticism and getting bad reputations edit okay i see from your other comments you meant separate companies so it is not really iron,1

no they are different because they do not know any better ,1
the left also seems to overreact but that could be a related side effect,1
it is simply a point of ideology that conservatives are more cold and logical while liberals are more emotional and empathetic it is not a bad thing or an insult either there are just different types of people you see this in broader policy all the time liberals want to help everyone while conservatives are always checking the balance sheets if we were a society of scrooge mcducks we would have a shit society but we would also be fucked if we had a society of john lennons too we need both sides to keep eachother in balance the real problem we are seeing now is that people mostly on the left but also some on the right are starting to view the balance itself as being wrong and refuse to backdown you see this most obviously with leftists calling to forcefully remove elected republicans from office https twitter com repcori status 1346926083350794240 s 19 among other things like the fact centrist ie moderate is like a slur the left uses and if we cannot restore the balance we are doom,1

everyone likes to think that they themselves are normal anything that deviates from that is looked at as being undesirable so when someone sees something on opposite ends of the spectrum from themselves it is seems unbelievable or not normal and that makes people uncomfortable in turn they avoid it look at the citizens politicians who have had their heads stuck in the sand during past years it is not because they did not see it it is because they did see it and did not want to acknowledge it why the truth can be ugly it causes people to consider possibly react and most are just too beat down and discouraged to want to do that it is easier to convince yourself that your mistaken than to have to fight something contrary to your existence this is the same mindset of persons who have severe medical symptoms but will not go to the doctor or an abused spouse who believes their abuser did not really mean to abuse them people do not want to acknowledge the ugly but sometimes you have to put on the armor of courage and swallow the red pil,1

anti semitism is not a new fad they were a marginalized group that have been scapegoats for hundreds of year,1
yep i noticed something was amiss in the early 90s with the education system in california i am originally from texas and we had wonderful public schools where i lived teachers wore pretty dresses to class we used air conditioned double decker greyhound busses for field trips to imax the houston zoo museums sam houston monument and ice skating at the galleria in california teachers wore sack dresses birkenstocks and took my son on a school bus to a ditch for a field trip that was the last straw got back to texas and the schools were almost as bad after also noticing the destruction of the family in the 70s 80s i knew something was up from there schools colleges continued to decline after being infiltrated by socialist communist teachers who insisted on indoctrinating our kids with their agenda to insure future liberal voters mothers were forced to work outside the home to keep the family afloat financially instead of nurturing the family in the home wages remained stagnant liberals infiltrated higher forms of government and attacked citizens through the irs spied on them through the cia they used the fbi cia doj and state dept to try and remove our duly elected beloved president trump they took over the msm social media and attacked conservatives while yapping on about unity this was in spite of their rioting attacks on americans through antifa blm now we have a real mess to clean up but the majority of that work should fall on the shoulders of the politicians of the republican party they were in a position to know who what the libs were doing they worked with them everyday they saw what issues they were voting on and how they voted thing is they did not let us the american people know so we could try to vote them out they let us down,1

funny how this is not banned but they constantly belittle conservatives leftists hypocrisy and double standards on full view these day,1
i saw somebody on twitter actually defending the double standard because the potus should be held to a higher standard it is always been funny to me that they will chant trump is not my president constantly until it suddenly becomes convenient for them to admit that trump is really the president also if there is one thing that i am looking forward to about trump not being president anymore it is the fact that leftist will not be able to use the whole he is the president so it is different argument i have seen leftists frequently use that argument when people point out that trump is living in their heads rent free leftists have told me that it is understandable to talk about trump non stop because he is the president and his actions affect everyone at least people will not be able to use that excuse anymore after he is out of offic,1

do you disagree with the view that it is the trumpists who have been threatening pence no i do not and those people should be banished from civil society but the threatening as far as i know was one video during the riots where a few people were chanting it leftists took the video and made it trend as a troll job you said the trump supporters should be banned which makes it sounds like a bunch of trump supporters on twitter are making those threats and it trended as a result there really is not anybody doing that,1

and let twitter know your reason whi,1
it s not like conservative voices can go elsewhere right now,1
yeah every stock is trending down today,1
when you have all the money the only thing you care about is pow,1
get off social media and militarize your wallets except your wallet is not going to be worth shit when they start printing money to get us out of the 30t hole we are in,1
10 of twitters value is 2 billion dollars not time for them to shit the bed yet but you can bet they are not,1
12 now,1
i know one the most famous yesterday deleted all her photo,1
12 now,1
dicks is dead and twitter will be dead too,1
i know apple brand loyalists who are ditching them because of the parler thing if the liberals and smooth talkers want to play god then let em i dont think they realize how much you dont actually need them in your lif,1
looks like it is gone up a bit since open,1
most likely not the decline was marginal just a typical red day on the market i have seen much worse tbh,1
look at the signal fiasco a 50 cent stock has blown up to 40 in 3 days because a buncha geniuses think it owns signal private messaging the ease of stock trading nowadays has a lot of people stock picking that probably should not be in the market that is how you get absolutely ridiculous valuations on some of these companies because if it is tech that means its only going to go up to the guy dumping 500 a week into their brokerage account the big boy players have been moving away from twitter months ago when it became virtually certain that they are going to get regulated by most governments in the world these social media platforms are pretty much built on sand and will probably set off the next major stock market crash it will not take much a drop in users contracting ad revenue by small business will set off the house of card,1
i am gonna be honest that is terrible stock advice the news is already out and the drop was negligible at best unless more news comes out that may be damning toward the platform it is not going to bleed dry it may go down a little bit over the next few days but it will be back to where it was by next week or the week aft,1
sorry to see you go goodby,1
been gone since they began censoring free speech can t even address concerns without being told you re wrong,1
why were you even using the twitter before then,1
i cannot believe any one permitted that trash on their phone anyway,1
me too but i did not even last a full day i needed to know what was going on i am too weak edit you guys took this way too seri,1
should not be a problem at al,1
it is worth it do it vthis needs to hurt them bad,1
keep it com,1
just did both fuck twitt,1
my account was made some many years ago i barely used it i deactivated it as soon as i heard about the ban,1
to follow president trump twitter ceo oops guess get woke go broke applies to us as well oh well i am already filthy rich good luck kids i think i will retire to my penthouse suite at the top of the capitol build,1
to get news faster from independent journalists and keep up with creators in hobbies i enjoy its not all polit,1
i never got twitter i thought about getting it but i spend to much time on my phone as it is that and now i am learning more about who runs that platform and i am not impressed to say the least,1
news official feeds from embassies government offices think tanks ngos some of us work in a field of timely information twitter was good for this before they became big broth,1
years ago i was able to view twitter on the web without the app just cannot like or com,1
haha just looked under most recent reviews it has a shit ton of 1 star review,1
done,1
you do not have to pay capital gains tax if you do not make any capital gains taps head,1
i think the board members have opened themselves up to a lawsuit for not acting in the shareholders best interest,1
to elect a man who wants to raise capital gains tax from 21 to 40 not wants to is going to thanks to my state he will start raising taxes probably before the end of the month,1
lol you honestly think twitter cares more about ideology than their bottom lin,1
leftist are there for trump they need to spread hate with rep going to gab or other platforms twitter will fade away,1
one hand washes the other and dems now have the house senate and white house twitter is too valuable for the democrats right now as a political tool if it is ever in real danger i could see them putting some grant to twitter in the name of combating online extremism in one of their omnibus bil,1
this 90 of twitter is a small week project by a competent full stack web programmer they are replaceable like the nyt only path forward is as state sponsored or billionaire sponsored approved media and they know it,1
they are banking on being the only govt approved platform after the coup is complete seems they are well on their way to that go,1
they already did the sold out when they went publ,1
switch to the more refined safety razors there are so many great blades to try and there is one for every face i made the switch a while back and never looked back 0 10 0 30 per razor nicer shave and the blade does not get clogged up every stroke even my wife switched to using one long story short fuck gillette edit this is hilarious some lefty edgelord paid money to reddit to award me a defeated award because i use safety razors comment only nancy boy deplorables use safety razors hahahahahah of course they left it anonymously as they lack a backbone how hypocritical must their life be probably identify as a communist and are unable to grow facial hair but are fine paying money to a corporation for magical internet pixels retard,1
do not bother will dollar shave club they have donated quite a bit of cash to the terrorist groups blm antifa,1
i have been using schick great product and not expens,1
no but the ceo resigned and they took an 8 billion write down,1
yeah there is no way to argue this is not because of banning trump,1
net neutrality for me but not for the,1
this is just the start the biden administration will administer the coup de grac,1
agreed they better take notice but for those of us who were hoping jack was going to get stomped today it did not happen,1
i just looked it closed yesterday at 51 48 per and closed today at 48 18 which would be about 6 5 again it is certainly not good especially considering twitters long march of being neither a winner or a loser ironically enough since 2017 gee what happened then it was on quite the bull run but i do not think it was the big crush some folks were looking for me included i fucking hate censorship,1
exactli,1
it s down to 12 now,1
i am gonna be honest that is terrible stock advice not at all jack has proven he has no interest in the financial responsibilities he has to the stockholders jack will sacrifice your money for his political opinions such a self absorbed ceo is a threat to stock prices at all times as he abandoned his core responsibility twitter investors did not invest in jack stock,1
that is a great hastag i would spread it on twitter before i left but too l,1
i was never on twitter to begin with but would occasionally click links to news posted on twitter whose format is awful and makes it difficult to follow what is going on i no longer click anything linking to twitt,1

i didn t i hardly used myself but read sometimes and many links was to twitter i was also working with social media but mostly with video,1
grow so bal,1
i doubt deleting my unused account will do any damage like using a pistol against galactu,1
i hope there is a mass exodus of people from twitter and that it is primarily people who work and actually afford things such that advertisers see how little gain there is on their platform,1
he will just take the company private buying back the low priced shares jack does not work for the shareholders he does not work for the users he works for the people that buy your user data and pay him to control what is and is not promoted like the chinese communist parti,1
hmmm wonder if i can set up alerts for that too good idea thank,1
ha brilliant modern problem meet modern solut,1
it certainly appears they have ignored their fiduciary responsibility virtue signalling legality and responsibility if you are jack,1
would keeping trump s account up be seen as best interests i m wondering if the cancel culture mob cancelling twitter if they didn t suspend trump would have been more damaging this is why every social network except twitter banned alex jones and then there was an awkward spotlight on them so they shrugged it off saying how he didn t do anything wrong but then magically made up a reason to ban him just days afterwards this is why i don t think these social media companies are in direct communication but they just see in which direction the winds are blowing in other words if you re at twitter and you see facebook and google youtube deplatforming someone then you follow suit,1
unless they share their politics or are pressured to share their polit,1
they are laying the groundwork for the stockholder to stakeholder convers,1
fingers crossed we are both wrong,1
jack and the moderators of twitter yes people who own stock in it noooooooop,1
yes twitter is one of the least viable publishers out there for ad revenu,1
this is probably very accurate without the outrageous twitter users causing engaging by the userbase what advertiser would even use twitter and once trump is out of office twitter ceases to be particularly relevant and maybe just maybe we can go back to focusing how they have rampant child pornography that makes tumblr look like a church choir,1
i remember pre trump there was widespread talk about how twitter was going to die because it had burned all the investor money and could not for the life of them show a profit then trump got in and made it his platform which spiked traff,1
i bought one of the old style 2 sided safety razors with replaceable 2 sided blades the replacement blades only cost about 20 for a pack of 100 i only shave twice a week and each blade is good for several shaves so after 4 years i am not even halfway through my 20 pack of blades lol,1
i did the same thing gillette pissed me off so i got into the old fashioned safety razor and straight razor the blades are super cheap i use each one like 4 times before tossing it i also bought a scuttle and brush to make the hot lather much better shaving experience overall imo fuck gillett,1
also their blades are trash,1
ceo resigned score that is the only thing that matters did anyone important take a significant personal hit otherwise 8 or 80 billions will not matt,1
dang that means it went up in the latter half of the day,1
you are misunderstanding now is not the time to pull out make the money back first you know factually the stock is going to go back up within a week or so if you waited till after it is already down a little bit it is already too late as is and you made a terrible financial purchase if you are at a loss right now i saw it months ago and had a feeling twitter was going to ban trump the first chance they got look at where we are at it is happened and the stock is hardly phased they had a much bigger drop at the end of october and look what happened it bounced back,1
it has more potential damage than doing noth,1
it depends how they count users the bigger the hit in deactivated accounts the better for everyone one of the only tools we have at the moment is things like this it has to hurt them or else they will see it as a sign that most of the country is fine with it and that censorship is ok,1
be sure to use ublock origin extension so they don t get any ad money,1
dang it you beat me to commenting thi,1
the defense they ll use is the same one they ll use to go after all of us dang,1
they admitted at the senate hearings after cruz co got the name of the apps big tech shares information coordinate banning over all platforms etc cruz actually pulled out screenshots of the inter company info sharing apps they all very much work together for the fatherland,1
part of twitters valuation comes from active daily users and amount of daily activity trump generated massive amounts of activity for twitter with him completely gone that activity goes away i am not sure how twitter is going to replace those impress,1
it really is twitter ads are the worst of anything in social media i have done digital and social for many years now and anyone who tells me that they spend ad money on twitter i know immediately is an idiot,1
twitters business model does not get its money from users or advertisers it gets its money from the entities that pay to mine your user data control what gets presented to the public and what gets hidden these customer entities include political organizations soros shells multinational corporations amazon google apple and government proxies chinese communist party owned compani,1
yep they killed their golden goose anyone notice how leftists do not seem to have paid attention to their fairy tales crying wolf is a daily occurr,1
they quietly made their business model into selling user data and having people pay to influence what you see and do not see for political purpos,1
gentleman get civilized buy a real straight razor and a piece of leather for stropping it with nothing beats a real shave circa the 1800,1
i did not see anyone else taking a personal hit from what i read,1
i prefer the term resigned in disgrace but resigned work,1
wouldn t staying and being a voice of descent do more though rather than let ourselves be snuffed out,1
okay i ll have to research that,1
there is still fiduciary responsibility they can preach danger all they want but stockholders only care about profits last time i checked being woke does not provide profits but quite the opposit,1

do you know about the proposed stockholder to stakeholder conversion globalists say valuations based on profits encourages companies not to do the right thing for society it s complicated but they want companies to be valued on how much good they do this is a prime exampl,1
jack does not care about the valuation jack does not work for the shareholders jack works for the customers and the only customers twitter has are those that buy user data and pay to control the flow of inform,1
i am not sure how twitter is going to replace those impressions the issue is even more critical than that with the twitter mob now aware of their power to remove public figures at whim you can and should expect to see them move on to a new target when there is only leftists and liberals remaining they will start to eat them too,1
what you are saying i should not buy stock in twitter right now on it is down sw,1
i have thought about it but have not made the leap yet i am particular about keeping a good edge on my hunting and kitchen knives but keeping a straight blade sharp enough to shave with seems like a whole different level maybe i will look into it though,1
that is cool the ceo had to have signed it off if anyone lower did it the ceo would have stayed and an entire dept liquid,1
being a voice of descent has not done anything until now and it does not affect their pocket,1
last time i checked being woke does not provide profits but quite the opposite except if they win the false claim that trumps tweets or dan bonginos tweets or your tweets are inciting violence then deplatforming those individuals becomes a legal duty which both supersedes their obligation to shareholders and also arguably benefits them not difficult to make the argument that a lawless company would scare investors or invite legal troubles that could threaten their stak,1
that argument and the power of the ftc to oppose monopolies may be our best routes forward,1
we have gone way beyond just big brother government now imagine if this was happening 20 years ago when the patriot act was being discussed recording everyones cell phone calls texts and emails seems pretty tame to an openly stolen election and full on censorship of the potus and half of america,1
youtube the social media senate hearings from like 2 months ago i think dorsey especially got grilled by cruz who must have an inside whistleblower ps dorsi is a snake and got caught in several li,1
how the hell does one measure that sounds idiot,1
yes but then their problem of active users and impressions counts only gets worse from a business perspective i am not sure that twitter has thought this through all the way to the end,1
their ad problems have always been there i am not sure how they are profitable i would love for someone who actually does digital to show a positive roas from twitter i think they rely quite a bit on political advertising shutting out half of the united states does not seem to be a good business decision but i am not a stock analyst,1
i am also a knife enthusiast and sharpener i free hand sharpen all your razor does is cut a little bit of hair it is not a kitchen or pocket knife you just need to strop it a few times on the leather after every shave i have not actually ever needed to sharpen mine and i already had a strop loaded up with compound for my other kn,1
so we just give up,1
they can hoodwink their user base and convince them that trumps video where he asked people to be peaceful was somehow inciting violence but they will not be able to sell that shit in a courtroom,1
dorsey looks like a was recruited by isis recently of course he is a snake he is a product of our government ironically just like isi,1
here is the summary which includes a link to the full proposal including legislation they force a demand for these stocks by saying anyone investing on behalf of an individual pensions mutual funds etc can only invest in these companies that prove they are doing things for the common good it s communism https corpgov law harvard edu 2020 10 26 from shareholder primacy to stakeholder capitalism and blackrock is already calling them stakeholders not shareholders and making the transition sustainable is their key word,1
it is not about business anymore they are in bed with the government now dorsey will be fine regardless of what happens to twitter in the futur,1

yeah but trump has a literal press room he s not a victim,1
she is right you know twitter and leftists are so sensitive they cannot handle a different opinion anymor,1
as an indian immigrant came here in 1st grade but whatever indians love trump,1

imagine being upset about extremists being banned from a forum they pay nothing to use are you guys equally outraged over islamic terrorists getting banned from twitter no reasonable conservative is being cleansed from twitter its the lunatic fringe and they deserve it,1
sooo twitter taught me that doubting election results and wanting to investigate is totally illegal but a government bragging about how they re setting up concentration camps that s just fine you re also allowed to call for burning books and science written by people of a certain skin color,1

just wanted to say i m a liberal and i don t support the current level of censorship if it was just a matter of locking the accounts of people like alex jones i would understand because the guy actually does try to incite violence but this is much broader ron paul had his facebook locked today and had no idea why he isn t even a trump supporter and he s not the type to incite violence to any liberals reading thinking that this should be disregarded as a problem only for conservatives consider what it would mean for you if you lost the ability to speak out on platforms that you have used for years if nothing else support conservatives so that you don t end up getting your own posts taken down simply because you disagree with facebook or twitter on a political issue one day we can have differences and still support one anoth,1

twitter should definitely ban all of the trump like world leaders out there but the double standard is obviously because twitter is an american company and has a vested interest in the country not devolving into chaos they don t care as much about or do not have as much information about what happens elsewhere facebook has the same problems and we on the left have been complaining about it for a long tim,1

looking at the list of notable permanent twitter suspensions on wikipedia https en wikipedia org wiki twitter _suspensions https en wikipedia org wiki twitter_suspensions it is clear that president trumps ban is of one of the most prominent if not the most prominent public figures on the list i personally think this clearly is within the rights of a private entity but i also understand why some are concerned that this is a steep and slippery slope one thing perplexes me about kangana ranauts comment if twitter is now acquiescent to chinese interests then why in 2019 did they ban 200k accounts connected to the chinese government for attempting to influence the protest movement in hong kong,1
not kangana,1

even as a casual bollywood fan i have no idea who she is too i think the number of upvotes on this comment by celebrity who has no relevance to politics shoes the deterioration that trump has caused to the once proud republican party now so called republicans have nobody but unknown celebrities to go for political wisdom,1
she is actually about every detail but twitter being greedi,1

people outside of the united states have a very different perspective on what is happening they see this all as a bunch of internal conflict blm protesting over the summer trump supporters protesting since november right vs left lots of drama now they see the capital overrun with trump supporters but it is not like some foreign government sent a special forces team and repelled down the side of the capital and occupied the building this is basically the narrative the left is pushing it is still just americans fighting amongst themselves with some really goofy meme pictures as a result but twitter banning donald trump that is quite significant to them that got their attention why well the reasons are obvious many countries use twitter if trump is so bad what about all these other foreign leaders with horrible human rights records and how does twitter determine which leaders get banned is twitter the arbiter of speech in the world needless to say foreign countries regardless of how they feel about trump will see this as a huge warning shot,1

how is _that_ the narrative the left is pushing we mostly think it was conspiracy theorists that would rather believe that there is a massive fraud campaign that undermined the entire electoral system over trump losing an election with a few coordinated white nationalists and fascists sprinkled in egging everyone else on watch their live streams https capitol hill riots s3 us east 1 wasabisys com directory html it s become pretty clear that illegal is a dog whistle it doesn t really mean that the votes were illegal it means they thought many of the people who voted shouldn t have been able to with a layer of conspiracy theory on top https youtu be ht20edymlxu t 2739 paxton says the quiet part out loud he admits that because they were able to restrict who voted trump won and then he says that their lawsuit was to try to impose that same standard on every other state illegal isn t about who voted legitimately it s about who gets to vote as i see it these people rioted are the capitol because they either believe that many people shouldn t have been able to vote during this election or that they believe there s a conspiracy so they don t have to confront any ugly feelings about wanting to deny their fellow americans their right to vote edit i should specify when i say coordinated i don t mean military style just that they plan to attend these events together and have shared goals that are quite anti democrat,1
yes twitter is the arbiter of who posts on their private platform twitter is the one who decides who is banned or not trump should have been banned even before presidency at the very latest after the border kz incid,1
it is clear you have no idea what the left is push,1
as a person outside the us it does not seem so much right vs left we do not actually see much political discussion at all the blm stuff seemed to be about institutional racism something we have in the uk with our police to stop and search being used against black people almost exclusively and nothing to do with left wing politics there also seems to be a big difference between what trump conspiracy theorists say and right wing politics too finally no one else is treating there corona virus as political either everyone is working together to try and do their best obviously people are critical of their responses particularly in the uk but it is more to do with frequency of lockdown or permitted activities rather than anything to do with the parties themselves the twitter and parler stuff seems to be more about terms of service violations rather than somehow a judgement on human rights history it should not be that hard to stay within the tos and take reasonable corrective measures when violations are highlighted anyway just some perspective from outside the us i am sure you have a much better understanding of the issues from insid,1
i m really hoping other free countries will help conservatives build the platforms we need for free speech we are extremely behind but that s what we need to compete and for freedom to win in the end,1
how are you so certain of how foreign countries view this i don t see where anyone would get an idea that special forces were repelling down the building what evidence do you have that shows how they view the twitter ban i don t follow this suppression of free speech narrative twitter is a private company not a government organization is there a conspiracy that certain factions in the government are controlling twitter behind the scenes maybe but the first amendment protects you from the government silencing y,1

yeah conservatives in our country generally dislike christian missionaries too,1
success of the big tech and democrats it was the conservatives folly for allowing it to happen,1
so whenever someone tries to reform some terrible part of the oppressive government there they will be met with fingers pointing at america saying this is what happens when you give people too much freedom that is exactly what i have been saying to people too now democracy in other parts of the world is totally dead,1

i would like to get a flair just to have polite discussion but when i was looking at the flair guidelines i say your views do not line up with r conservatives views only mods can assign user flair and user flair is only for conservatives once you have a solid history of comments in r conservative and have been commenting in the subreddit for at least two weeks that is the right time to request flair via the link at the bottom of this page if you are not even somewhat conservative do not bother asking we are going to check your comment history and we may ask you probing questions about your views if you are not measurably conservative do not ask for flair we will defend our turf and you can always try again later when you have spent more time posting the subreddit proving that you deserve flair if you request a flair that does not indicate that you are primarily conservative do not be surprised if we reject it we constantly get requests like libertarian moderate centrist and even progressive conservative no no no and no ancaps are not conservatives you are living a fairy tale when you think a society with no authority at all can function if you ask for a terrible flair that is not conservative you are digging yourself into a hole and even if you ask for something different you will probably have to prove yourself to us we do give variants on some of the above libertarian conservative and moderate conservative are acceptable but we are probably going to be watching you closely people with those flairs have given us trouble in the past and we will probably send you a warning to make legitimate conservative conversation in those posts or you may lose your flair,1
how long does it take to get a flair,1

i thought liberals were completely against this argument why is everyone citing it now that it fits your agenda of suppressing free speech so incredibly hypocritical and how are you going to compare a tiny bakery to a tech oligopoly that controls what people see and read about on a daily basis why are liberals suddenly against freedom of speech and freedom of the press it s scari,1
not even close there are thousands of bakeries and the bakery was not refusing service they just refused to put a certain message on the cake that was a stunt because the gay couple could have gotten their cake done elsewhere twitter is the defacto public square other services have popped up and then the tech oligarchs attempt usually successfully to squash them so they control online speech very very different scenario,1
can i get some flair mods i want it to say nevertrumperbetacuckantifasoysoldi,1
i am from kerala and a communist voter but i definitely side more with the republicans than democrats most indians bar some support trump even muslims here support trump because of the simple fact that he did not start any new war in the middle east also due to the fact that he solved the qatar crisis many of our people work there and most of our states gdp comes from foreign remittance so yes i agree there might be some but most indians like trump,1

there is a gas station between me and my work that an indian guy owns he s a really cool guy and i used to go in there so much that he gave me a coffee one morning on the house because i was constantly in there buying stuff always smiling always cheerful and i ve never met a guy that loved american values more than him,1
well between donald trump and the nuclear family is racist and socialism is the future democrats yea trump would be the family values and work ethic guy,1
slow clap,1
i laughed because this is true but if you look at the bigger picture then it makes sense democrats in the us generally support blm i m speaking in generalities because it seems that is all america is capable of now when i say blm i mean the organization not the slogan the slogan is common sense and i truly don t think any respectable individual has a problem with but blm the organization is a marxist organization that supports the destruction of the nuclear family so when zooming out to look at the bigger picture someone who supports family values will likely support the candidate that has not endorsed blm despite that candidate being a hypocrite when it comes to these valu,1

because india is highly unstable an unreliable ally and downright incompetent militarily india is not the largest threat to china in the region it literally is the us and our military bases in japan korea and sea china has control of ports in sri lanka bangledesh and is allied with pakistan making it impossible for india to become a naval power in it is own fucking ocean maybe the us can count on india when they can stand on their own fucking feet,1

it s not the defacto public square though it s one of many online services owned by private entities although available to the public they have their own terms of services and rules just like reddit and even when broken by high ranked public officials are given multiple warnings and chances to appeal correct violations i m not seeing how a proponent of small government could argue that twitter or any of these companies don t have the authority to run their businesses how they see fit or that they fall under anti 1a when lacking a monopoly on speech,1

it is but now they are trying to silence arnab by hook or crook,1
when you have to drag out a to be honest quite horrible case from 2005 maybe that issue is not as pervasive as you think it is this is extremely powerful notice how they are dragging out the capitol riots still to this day a week later even though trump supporters have not even so much as hosted another rally or protest since then meanwhile blm and antifa groups literally terrorized our cities for months on end while our politicians encouraged it normalized it called people racist if they did not agree with it and essentially forced us to cover our eyes and pretend nothing was happening because there was nothing we could do about it,1
no when abusive world leaders and communists applaud your efforts and take your side you see that as twitter being politically biased i think you re subscribing too hard to defend trump instead of defending your political view here take out trumps name from the event on the 6th which this is really about we re conservatives and even if we re not strictly trump supporters we are us citizens alike and likely republicans alike if those tech companies allow trump to directly use their platform solely then they become the platform used to disenfranchise the country regardless of how anyone feels there isn t a reason to burn federal and state to the ground and hasn t been a thought up until this individual held office at best this presidency has inspired treason and no tech company should use technology to help that happen they re promoting an agenda to destroy the system we both pay taxes to build and maintain and twitter is like a gigantic infrastructure megaphone for it,1
twitter is a private company i do not think i am the one who needs to educate myself,1

twitter is a government run agency just because it s publicly traded means it is held to the same standards as government should newspaper organizations be mandated to print ever op ed that is sent to them because of the first amendment stop trying to misconstrue my point by attempting to attack my intelligence especially when it is you who is spewing ignor,1

dude they are indian americans not indians oc talked about indian,1
you re massively overreacting the woman on the delta plane was removed for refusing to wear a mask check out the posts in r publicfreakout someone on the plane posted there and provided context,1
ok first of all i think you are confusing leftist and liberals i assure you massive corporations such as facebook and twitter are not leftist the people who got banned from twitter in the recent purge where accounts that were in support of what happened that day or continued to spread misinformation about the election results thus warranting the response and about the delta story i am sure she did more then just say trump 2020 to get banned from a flight and the decision to stop those who participated in the capitol hill riot from flying or those who refuse to abide by the mask mandate came from the union of flight workers so bottom up,1
they are private companies you agree to their tos when you create an account you may not read it but you agree to it nonetheless social media companies can suspend or ban accounts at their discretion it is a free service they do not owe anyone anything in fact i would argue forcing a company to keep an account active despite tos violations would be authoritorian monopoly or not it is their platform and they can do whatever they want with it i am sorry you cannot understand that,1
huh did you mean to reply to someone else you said that anyone can get flair if they aren t a troll and the subreddit rules state that you should not even try to get flair unless you are conservative going so far as saying you ll be watched if you re a libertarian conserv,1
lol i have been asking for week,1
are you playing so dumb for real so many people these days access through the internet even getting their tv radio content now so cutting that access not just social media and controlling what people hear see the leftists goal is denial of access to so many americans if you cant understand that you really dont know much,1
it is the defacto public square millions use it as their source of information and discussion far more than most other platforms this is why trump and crazy eyes were not allowed to block people on their twitter account i believe in small government and small business i am not a fan of huge globalist multinational corporations that attempt to influence everything we do,1
you re deliberately ignoring the fact that they enjoy the liability protections of being classified as a public platform while inconsistency applying their rules with a severe ideological slant twitter has done nothing to remove calls for violence when perpetrated by democrats or for democrat backed causes like blm maxine waters literally called for democrats to swarm republicans in the streets the ayatollah has called for the death of jews and israel the chinese embassy justified the genocide being committed against the uyghur people all on twitter all without repercussions denying service for breaking terms of use is one thing denying service to some for breaking terms of service while allowing other political factions twitter happens to agree with to break the law on their platform and break terms of service while enjoying liability protection as a platform is another not to mention many conservatives were purged without breaking terms of service there are unwritten rules on social media platforms that only apply against conservatives and liberals are free to routinely break terms of service as long as it fits the narrative the social media companies like their liability protections need to be stripped if they continue to act as a publisher picking and choosing who is and isn t allowed to break the law and their rules or else they can apply their rules fairly and continue to enjoy the liability protections but they obviously have no interest in that,1
exactly most middle class educated indians prefer democrats because their policies are a bit lenient towards us whereas republicans atleast trump tend to put american workers first which results in immigration becoming hard,1
if one person cannot have free speech than it follows that no one has it the problem is not that 1 guy got banned its the precedent that banning him set,1
i blame the president and his enablers but i give lots of blame to right wing media i listen to people like rush and dennis prager and they fed into the disinformation they would call people to fight and to be warriors pump up these folks who are easily led without any sense of what is news vs opinion they would say the left is destroying the countrry and get people all scared and when the president says to go to the capitol what did you expect would happen,1

personally i find it laughable that you are trying to convince me you are a conservative especially given i ve heard everything you just said come out of the mouth of every democrat i ve ever spoken to you say that communists and bad world leaders supporting trump here proves he is bad but the bad world leaders you are referring to aren t supporting trump here they are arguing against twitter banning government officials and i find it ironic you are so happy to use the morals of other world leaders to denounce trump but fail to see that everything the democratic party stands for is entirely supported by every evil government to ever exist socialism lenin stalin mao gun control hitler the list goes on and on the entire democrat platform is advocated by complete despot world leaders also conservatism has nothing to do with supporting the government no matter what it does that is called being a blind idiot there is no reason to burn federal and state to the ground i m sorry but have you seen a single news story about the government for the last 50 years i m frankly shocked it took this long for americans to storm the capital this presidency did not inspire treason and why you think that baffles me the riots over the summer the republican party and fox turning on its supporters the complete and total disregard for the american people when considering covid relief the capital should have burned 3 4 times by this point and again if you are advocating that tech companies betray the principle of free speech i ask you this if twitter is going to curate the content allowed on their site how does this make them a free platform and not a publisher and if they are going to allow some ideas and not others then they should be held liable for the ideas they endorse aoc cuomo and kappernick calling for more riots and twitter endorsing it especially financially with kappernick then they should be brought to court and sued as they are liable for the criminal acts that just took place but something tells me you wouldn t support that,1

1 democrat people and democrat politicians are not the same thing stop acting like i said they were 2 social services are not socialism please learn how to tell the difference 3 yes trump is the work ethic and family values guy jesus is it that hard to understand the difference between trump himself and what trump promotes the american dream view that trump pushes the idea that you can work hard and better your financial situation the idea that your family is your own and the government should not be all up in your business all of these things are family centered and work ethic centered it s really not that hard to understand if you can get trump himself to stop living rent free in your brain like a maniac,1

india cannot even mobilize enough troops to engage with china chinese naval power completely dwarfs any presence india has in the indian ocean and pacific if india wants to utilize it is manpower it needs to cross the himalayas which it cannot do logistically with large enough numbers alternatively india can try to move through the khyber pass which is controlled by fucking pakistan a state that is hostile to india the reality is the us is the only real challenge to china in the region,1
they might have decent weapons and such does not mean they know how to use them especially their janky ass airforce that cannot make a fighter jets bomber like the us or russia,1
most indians support trump because modi held a rally together with trump 98 could not tell you once policy position of trump why does it matter how many of those people support trump how are they in anyway influencing what trump would do,1

it s a false flag they re going to use it to try to push through radical policy change example gun laws anytime a random teenager goes akimbo in a school 9 11 was a false flag to generate enough support in this country to turn the middle east into a parking lot we re still looking for those wmd,1
i see i disagree with you and conservatism can be in different spectrums you re right to remind that it has nothing to do with the government or alignment necessarily with a specific political body i believe what you re trifling with is similar to the repealed sedition act and espionage act simply put those who do not remember the past are condemned to repeat it fwiw it was controversial at the time and aimed at criticism of the us during ww1 similar concept different content but in this ballpark of free speech i believe there are more marches on the 16 19th maybe more people will come on down to burn down the capital as you re saying the capital should have been burned down 3 4 times by now i m sure those that feel this way will have their opportunities for more absurdity what s better is that the system has very large jails for traitors to the united states and i can t wait to see them overflow i d encourage you rather to vote and be active politically to influence your local community instead our government is intended for us as a group to come to a decision without violence on a different note twitter apple amazon and google over parler should be held in court over the right to free speech,1

the double standard has existed for awhile the left despises israel personally have not researched the uyghur as much as i should but i am going to assume they are religious conservatives and that would explain their lack of support i understand twitter and other private companies can do what they want my fear is when the government begins persecuting people for their political religious beliefs and taking away 1a right,1
well then they should be held accountable as well i think the chinese official technically did not break the rules but it is weird that the ayahtollah did not get banned can you show the tweet where he said that also maduro got banned of twitter and he is a socialist,1

conservative here no if this forum restricted you from accessing the reddit platform then yes anybody can get flair in sub if you are not a troll can we just agree that anybody can get flair in sub if you are not a troll is not true i am not the initial commenter that asked if flaired only impeded free speech just that flairs are not available to those of other views on this subreddit being a troll is not the disqualifying criteria as you state there are terms and conditions to the subreddit and if you do not abide by them you are not able to use it in this case if your views do not line up with the subreddit they may limit or completely deny your ability to discuss my point is not about free speech which in my opinion does not exist on reddit it was never a bastion of free speech as the founders of reddit pointed out,1
yea i did and they say i need more tim,1
you dont think all those are joining the lefts crusade wait and watch its all just starting twitter is just part of the whole thing its happened far more broadly than that,1

unfortunately i think you and i have come to an impasse i suppose it boils down to your optimism about voting being worth anything at all the congress s willingness to stamp down on covid relief for 8 months while americans suffered yet they can draft articles of impeachment in a day or two flat they can agree to send billions of dollars overseas but not to help their own people all while strangling small businesses and the income of millions of americans with covid regulations that do nothing but funnel money into the hands of the largest corporations in america while small businesses die by the day i hate to say it friend but your vote is worthless they do not care about you nor have they ever you will never see things improve because you give them no reason to improve and i don t say this as a partisan conservative the republicans and democrats are the same they agree on a single thing and that is the only thing that matters their own self interests they do not represent their people anymore the republic is dead so long as they are in power so yes i hope congress burns to the ground metaphorically speaking i don t wish death on those who currently hold power i don t want them harmed but the fact of the matter is that they cannot be allowed to continue in this way for the good of america both left wing and right wing they need to fal,1

absolutely and they re emboldened now more than ever i very much worry that the coming administration won t do anything to prevent concerted big tech censorship from getting worse while still granting them liability protection because it benefits their side at the moment the total lack of principles the left has demonstrated when it comes to section 230 and big tech overreach is extremely worrying but unfortunately not unexpect,1
here s one of many tweets calling for the elimination of israel https mobile twitter com khamenei_ir status 531366667377717248 maduro s account is still up so i m not seeing where he was banned i generally lean libertarian but the collusive and oligopolistic practices we ve seen from big tech in the last few days against parler are concerning whenever conservatives complain about censorship and section 230 protections for twitter and facebook we re always told go make your own platform then what happens when google apple amazon twitter and facebook all collusively prevent an alternative platform like parler from being hosted accessed or used what s next go create our own scalable cloud host go create our own search engine go create our own devices go create our own internet at what point does the combination of extensive partisan censorship liability protections for a claimed platform clearly acting as a publisher and collusive oligopolistic behavior preventing other platforms from existing constitute some regulation or at least stripping of ridiculous liability protections if this was all happening to the left s ideologies there would undoubtedly be calls for extreme intervent,1
nice try but nope that was twitter s justification as far as what rules they claimed trump and other conservatives broke not mine and yet they don t enforce their own rules equally across all users not even to the most extreme examples of authoritarian regimes calling for and justifying genocide these are the very most extreme examples and even in those cases twitter isn t enforcing their own rules while enforcing their rules against american conservatives that certainly isn t a comparison between the us and iran ccp but you clearly deliberately misinterpreted what i said in bad faith,1
can we just agree that anybody can get flair in sub if you are not a troll is not true no we cannot agree you are wrong i am not the initial commenter that asked if flaired only impeded free speech just that flairs are not available to those of other views on this subreddit you can have a different view you just cant be a troll in this sub which is the same rule as every other sub as you state there are terms and conditions to the subreddit and if you do not abide by them you are not able to use it correct do not be a troll it is easy you are commenting right now not hard in this case if your views do not line up with the subreddit they may limit or completely deny your ability to discuss yes but you are not banned from the whole platform just a sub what is so hard to understand about this concept trump was not banned from a section of twitter he was banned from all of it my point is not about free speech which in my opinion does not exist on reddit it was never a bastion of free speech as the founders of reddit pointed out i do not know what the founders intended it to be if they though they could make it a bastion of free speech while at the same time allowing liberal progressives on it they should have known it was destine to fail,1
blm just want cops to be accountable they were not trying to overthrow the government and kill the vice president maybe if the competition cracked down on people doing illegal things they could stick around if the esrb did not step up and regulate the video game industry the government would have had to step in,1
exactli,1
i usually don t mind conservatives but i hate the ones that support donald trump and what he represents well that would be a majority of conservatives so why are you here especially with what happened at the white house i do not mind liberals or progressives or democrats i just detest anyone who supported supports obama and biden after what happened with all that drone murd,1
for a vocal minority they sure do have the media and virtually every other large business by the bal,1
in regards to your votes worth from a software developers perspective we tend sometimes to see people use apps in a different way because we didn t give them a way to accomplish what they desire i think fundamentally the issue resides in that we have to elect officials that may serve 1 2 1 4 etc of our desires rather than our ideas themselves being presented then direct voting ie in some ways it would almost be better to elect ideas rather than individuals in some ways i feel as though because we don t have a way to do that in our system now of course people are angry and feel the vote holds no value it s not tangible furthermore if i wanted to see where my money actually goes assess the books and cash flow to make an educated decision on anything the systems in our country do not come in a modern format on which for me to search with ease i can run advanced formulas over fantasy football yet cannot interactively analyze online spending for the local town maybe i ll build an app and propose it as a contractor to local government statements the people and not their ideas make are not documented by the institution itself to establish credibility for career politicians i can agree we need at the very least a discussion as a country on modern problems with modern solutions i m tentative to use reform insurrection or protest,1
i m not going to believe the rhetoric of a man who doesn t adhere to said rhetoric whatever happened to old school republicans trump is more of an elitist than obama could ever b,1
so when you say socialism you are referring to the authoritarian stage of marxism ie soviet russia but you are not referring to social democracy ie sweden that is interesting so conceivably you would might support more for lack of a better word socialist policies if you felt sure that there was no risk of marxism or the end of private property sometimes i wish that i could snap my finger and remove all connotation from all words what value do you give concepts like individuality community autonomy society independence and interdepend,1
sorry perhaps you misinterpreted i am saying that those democrats the literal faces of the party do not say things like the nuclear family is racist,1
probably because modern day capitalism was built by draining wealth from less developed nations and imposing racial caste systems on them while simultaneously enslaving human beings to produce commodities at suppressed prices which creates unbelievable profit margins and the said profits were critical in the success of modern day capitalism i m by no means an extremist or anti capitalist but it s not hard to see the reasons why some think that,1
actually i am a conservative lmao have been since 2017 nothing i said has been false i do not like the ccp but i am willing to give a more objective perspective on them than the average redditor who has never been to china and does not understand the nuances of chinese culture history and geopolitics i have been called trumptard libtard wumao before and it is all by the same type of people on different sides of the political spectrum people who are too fucking ignorant to engage in an actual convers,1
conservatives constantly preach that government should stay out of private business and people s lives why should others give a damn when you suddenly realize it can become necessari,1
so you are invoking the but that is not fair clause about a private company whose autonomy is protected by the constitution of the united states exercising that right by deciding what content can and cannot be posted on their platform and saying that makes them no better than the communist party wild,1
blm is a marxist organisation they used violence to push their political agenda and that is the definition of terrorism they killed people this summer the people who stormed the capital should not have done that but i have seen several videos of cops waving them on and opening doors and standing aside as they walked in this was not an insurrection attempt,1
better to be a snowflake than a fucking traitor the liberals were right about trump all along dumbass too bad brainwashed republicans would rather side with a coup than admit they were wrong,1
to grab a bag of popcorn and entertain myself and that s funny considering trump carried out more drone strikes than obama in just two years of him being presid,1
just like majority of conservatives who are anti marijuana and anti sex right,1
mmm i agree with you on a lot of what you said there we absolutely need more modern ways to track a particular politician local governance to assess their actual leadership furthermore i love the idea of voting more on ideas rather than people the trouble is getting the corrupt people in government to actually follow the ideas people want as for actually showing where the money goes that s a double edged sword sure i agree that we need it but the fact of the matter is that the people currently are already very angry about the spending exposed by the covid relief bill if you were to show the current american populace where their money is going constantly especially right now that anger would only escalate to rage with a fair amount of the population i wish there was a way for the people to hold their government to account in a much more direct way without the need for empassioned and angry uprising but the reality i fear is that anger and hate are the only motivations strong enough to make the american people get off their asses and do something about this blantant failing of the government on every level and i fear that will undoubtably lead to bloodshed as it already has in the capit,1
so when are you gonna denounce all the democrats that preach socialism while being rich as fuck exactly and old school republicans don t exist just like old school democrats that believed in free speech and the american dream,1
sweden is not socialist never have been individuality is everything community only matter in an extremely local sense autonomy is equal to individuality society is a framework the borderline around the country never intended to run everything within it akin to principles independence goes with autonomy and individuality interdependance belongs between family and tight knit friend circles at best,1
one of blm s official declarations was that they wish to attack the western prescribed nuclear family structure biden pelosi aoc and sanders have all thrown their support behind blm try again,1
because being conservative doesn t mean you re necessarily an anarcho capitalist what it sounds like you re saying is that we agree that some intervention is necessary but because it currently benefits you you don t want intervention out of what spite that sounds like a lack of principles to me and really i m not even arguing for intervention so much as reform of section 230 protections to account for when public platforms act more as publishers than platforms and prevent them from enjoying liability protection while acting as a publisher and potentially giving them the opportunity to regain said protections if in the future they decide they want to behave as a platform rather than a publish,1
again nice try i would have no issue with their inconsistent application of their own rules if they didn t enjoy the liability protections of a public platform maybe you re not familiar with section 230 do you see no issue with their classification as a public platform that affords them liability protection while they clearly act as a publisher curating content according to ideology if a media outlet like msnbc or fox news allows content that breaks the law they can be held liable twitter curates their content with a political slant similarly to other publishers while being completely free from liability for anything posted on their platform,1
i have seen police doing more damage to people during the summer or did you forget the old guy pushed to the ground and left bleeding from the head so because a few corrupt cops said it was ok all crime is on the table they were literally chanting hang pence and you still think it was not an insurrect,1
well i guess you now fall in both categori,1
please don t try to reason with this guy he s actually brain dead like so many of these people on this sub trust me i ve tried you won t be able to change any of their minds they re brain washed and can t do any critical thinking of their own just what their saviour trump says it s best to steer away and ignore them,1
you hate trump and those who support him but your ok supporting obama biden drone killings because you hate trump and those who support him lol,1
i cant tell if your being serious i also cant remember the last time the media or major corporations courted the conservatives and their causes the last decade has been inquisition lite and you would have to be obtuse or willfully ignorant to not see that anyhoo,1
if you were to show the current american populace where their money is going constantly especially right now that anger would only escalate to rage with a fair amount of the population it is the same argument as to why you cannot just get rid of social services food stamps for example overnight you have to wend people off of an addiction or it can have adverse effects exposing truth is no different the truth hurts a populace this brainwashed has to be trickle truthed or they simply will not believe what they are being told since the lies are so deeply rooted in their thought processes that anything else is simply foreign,1
i live in a social democratic country that has several socialist elements while retaining a market economy i don t mind it when i shattered my femur riding my dirtbike i never had to worry about crippling medical costs when i had a psychotic episode on drugs i was given outstanding mental health assistance when i lost my job i was able to receive payments which supplemented me while i searched for a new job without said payments i don t know where i would be i don t know about you but my experience with big bad socialism is that it can bring serious benefits to a society just as a strong capitalist element can you d best be more wary of the rich who want you to think socialism is inherently evil to protect their own wealth rather than those who would be willing sacrifice some of it for the greater good,1
ah yet another distinction there is blm the organization and blm the sentiment movement the organization definitely has issues while the general sentiment is something that everyone can get behind they have thrown their support behind the sentiment not the organization it is almost like politics is nuanced or someth,1
they are a private entity it is twitter com not twitter gov section 230 protects them from being held liable for what non twitter i e the public posts on their platform without it twitter would have to ban much much more content as they could be held accountable for all the content on their platform btw fox news is provided the exact same first amendment protections with the obvious exception that their content is created exclusively by their own employees meaning if they slander then they can be held accountable please climb down off your cross before you hurt yourself,1
biden won fair and square pussy no proof of fraud not even a trump appointed judge will hear the case because there is no evidence no fraud trump is done facts matter and maga cult is dead drink the kool aid and go down with him or wake up and smell the coffee your children and grandchildren will be embarrassed to admit you were a red hat,1
when did i say i support obama biden and their drone killings what they re doing is absolutely horrible on both sides regardless of what party they re in i just said that because of how dumb your example was since trump is doing more damage than obama was i m not even american i m canadian give me a proper argument next tim,1
most of the states still prohibits marijuana also they do have almost draconian view of sex this is not because most republicans are against marijuana or extra marital sex this is because the vocal minority in republican party is working against these issues yes i am not talking about media or corporations i am talking about state govern,1
truth my man,1
i don t need the rich for me to think socialism is evil all i have to do is look at any country that adopts it sure maybe your country has a few social benefits but those benefits invariably come off the back of the capitalist nature of your markets as well as off the backs of the american system as well as you should know the vast majority of new medical treatments origininate from our system due to the ability to actually monatize the production of such treatments government subsidies are never enough to fund the research necessary and without the ability to recoup their costs such treatments would never exist and that isn t even to speak of how generally more advanced the healthcare in america is than its european or canadian counterparts now is healthcare more expensive than it should be yes but a lot of that originates from how broken congress is fundamentally hence why the congress desperately needs term limits and a completely new set of people in it,1
they threw their support behind the rioters not the general sentiment aoc herself directly advocated for the rioting making her the worst example of them all blm the sentiment movement is not divorced from the rioting done in its name especially given the movement s reluctance to denounce the riot,1
you re really twisting yourself into a pretzel here and it s hilarious public platforms don t get to have their cake and eat it too they don t get to act as publishers curating content with an ideological slant while not being liable for the content they do allow i m not arguing for the outright removal of section 230 protections i m arguing that if they re going to curate their content inconsistently to support a political ideology and shape public opinion that they should be held liable for the content they do allow or if they decide to enforce their rules to all users ie act as a platform rather than a publisher they can continue to enjoy liability protections you re clearly misunderstanding that what you said about fox isn t an exception it s literally what defines them as a publisher the fact that they entirely control what content is and isn t put forward just like twitter has done with conservatives and liberals deciding that some political ideologues are free to break their own rules willy nilly while others can be removed without breaking rules either they re a publisher that curates their content without needing to use rules to justify their curation or they re a platform that enforces their rules equally to all us,1
you seem very unstable there s a safe place for those suffering from tds it s called polit,1
no you started by giving your reasoning for why you hate trump and anyone who supports him oddly you do not hate any other president or his supporters if you do and i am wrong tell me which president you support so i can tell you how terrible he is and why he and his supporters should be detested why are you even in a conservative forum,1
that recouping of costs comes directly from extorting the american people countries like mine circumvent this by outright denying patents for medications and medical treatment if the price is deemed to be extortionate if only americans cared more about their own people s quality of life and health than they did a pharmaceutical companies billion dollar profits they could do something similar your healthcare is broken because it is run for profit rather than for the good of the people i think you ll find that the vast majority of leftists and liberals want policies such as the ones that i described rather than a complete dismantling of capitalism and full on communism if your country is so rich and powerful and sure of itself in an economical sense why can it not provide the benefits and luxuries that other countries manage to provide to theirs while retaining a strong market economy and vibrant capit,1
who mentioned anything about rioting we are talking about the far left ideologies everything comes back to the rioters with you guys people ransack target and you think oh that proves black lives do not matter i am not racist for hating black people smh,1
it definitely sounds like you have got some rules in mind that you are applying or demanding be applied to another entity twitter but really are just trying to justify your own hyperbole that twitter is some how stifling free speech in this country at the end of the day twitter fox news 4chan and rotten com are all definitely allowed to decide what content is posted on their platform and will do so based on the whims of their advertisers way more than any sort of rules that you believe they claim to follow and if you do not like the decisions that they have made then you are definitely allowed to not engage their platform that is where the liability exists for private entities in this country engagement in the free market and which is something i would hope that a poster in r conservative would understand,1
the truth hurts your little maga brain doesn t it point out one falsehood in my comment and i ll leave you little boys alone forev,1
that s just one of many reasons i hate him and his far right supporters how can you defend someone that urged his supporters to storm the capitol how could you be okay with trump terrorists raiding the white house carrying the confederate flag bringing ropes and zip ties to kidnap state officials bringing pipe bombs and other explosives to cause harm and destruction to government property beating a policeman to death just because trump told them to because he lost the election with no facts to back up his stupid claim that the election was rigged it s impossible to reason with you or even have a conversation with you folks i m not saying any president was perfect and i know they all had their flaws but trump is by far the worst american president in history that i m knowledgeable about and i hope that fucker gets impeached and thrown into jail but knowing america he wont,1
if your country is so rich and powerful and sure of itself in an economical sense why can it not provide the benefits and luxuries that other countries manage to provide to theirs while retaining a strong market economy and vibrant capitalism because it is too busy paying for your s take even a moment s glance at who pays for the defense spending for the eu and every other multinational defense force and you ll very quickly realize where a lot of america s funding goes arguably if america stopped funding these things they could easily afford more social systems like you have but the problem is that you would have to find funding for your own defense more than relying on the multinational ones as much this would likely negatively impact your social systems as a result like i said the healthcare system is overpriced and broken but that is mostly due to the corruption and outright stupidity of our legislature who allow such things to pass,1
you don t know a damn thing about what i think and it shows yes it comes back to the rioters because the movement as a whole and the democrats support the rioting if you had your house burned down and the government was outright endorsing it you ve be pretty focused on that too i am not a racist nor is anyone here that s simply your scapegoat to try to avoid that fact that the literal faces of the democratic party endorse rioting but only when it comes from their sid,1
if you don t understand the need for section 230 reform or that social media companies are operating outside what s intended to be protected you re either a staunch anarcho x or a hypocrite again platforms and publishers play by different rules and social media companies are currently exercising the liability free status of a platform while acting as a publisher while collusively working with other big tech companies to prevent any competitors from existing i m generally quite libertarian but the law as it is isn t being enforced against big tech firms they re certainly in violation of the sherman act over what s happened with parler over the last few days while enjoying overarching liability protection you re also conveniently forgetting to address that twitter isn t just allowing some members to break the rules but they re also allowing some users to break the law with incitement of violence calls for the elimination of a certain jewish country your party seems to take so much issue with the ayatollah being the one allowed to break these rules and incite violence on the platform without removal in this specific example your party is constantly trying to restrict free speech unless it benefits you can t yell fire in a crowded theater right apparently that doesn t apply if the theater is full of jews and you ll start fighting tooth and nail about not restricting calls to violence if it firs with your ideology very strang,1

on the contrary your politicians may shittalk it all they like but they want it just as much as our s do,1
no i m directly calling twitter antisemitic but antisemitism itself isn t against the law incitement of violence against jews certainly is but you refuse to address that twitter allows the ayatollah to call for the end of israel on twitter while banning conservatives with vague justifications again while enjoying the liability protections of a platform while acting as a publisher the fact that you see this as imagined while conservatives are being deplatformed from every major platform along with the standing president of the united states is laughable something tells me you d see the issue if it happened to your side i m perfectly fine with these platforms being biased in the absence of overarching liability protections while violating the nature of those protections bu acting as publishers don t be an asshole doesn t apply when calling fire in a theater right so why are some allowed to call fire and some aren t even allowed to exist,1
you are not american you call our presidents scum you say you are conservative but insult conservatives why are you here again,1
why do i have to be american to be on this sub i follow american politics when did i say i m conservative i just told u i m liberal in the beginning i think u have dyslexia i can be in whichever sub i want to be in i felt like browsing through this sub to see what other conservatives feel about what happened and so far i m disappointed in you american,1

it s got to be human nature orwell is being thrown around a lot people are learning and buying i suffered through the first part of the movie a while ago and turned it off very interested in watching it through now,1
only a little just come out and say it we re in serious trouble people need to wake up,1
the worst thing about the way the world is going is that it was the uk that gave the world the concept of personal liberty and natural rights in many ways the cradle of the philosophy that enabled western civilisation and the brits seem to have happily thrown that all away still remember watching some video interviews with soviet dissidents no matter how bad their lives were they thought of america as the icon of freedom and just knowing it existed gave them the strength to continue to struggle of course that is why there has been such a concerted effort to destroy it right now it looks like they have won,1
you are overreacting until you are not we are in deep trouble and none of us is doing anything about it,1
i m so tired of being called a nazi for caring about basic human rights while the fuckers calling it are plagiarizing the playbook,1
delet,1
projection they can t be the nazis and fascist because they have established conservatives as such,1
kinda like animal farm where the animals overthrow the humans that control the farm declare all animals equal and four legs good two legs bad but over a course of events the animals start walking on two legs and behaving like humans not saying two legs good four legs better and essentially becoming what they swore to destroy,1
it s terrifi,1
no it is ok you see by definition the only voices being silenced are nazi ones so there is no problem with this see you got silenced must have been a nazi,1
no wonder violence occurred on the capital building what did you expect i mean i dunno about you but i kinda was expecting conservatives not to invade the capital building and instead just have a good ol fashioned trump rally especially since we spent the better part of the summer labeling ourselves as the law order party while criticizing the violence during the summer blm protests but perhaps i was expecting too much,1
they also went all in on silencing political opponents after blaming them for an attack on the german capitol which included many nazis posing as their political oppon,1
reminds me of all the facebook trolls and twittertards talking about how the capitol riot was all about white privelege lol what privelege a unarmed woman was shot and killed the people are being hunted down all over the country and arrester and will rightly go to jail for a long time why wasn t any of this shit being done in all the blm antifa riots in all of 2020 instead of treating them with kid gloves making excuses for their riots letting them burn down cities cause billions in damage burn police precincts down while the cops are ordered to abandon it they tried to burn down a police station with cops inside attacking a federal courthouse nightly for over a month taking over downtown in a major us city for over a month and declaring it not a part of the us where they had roaming armed guards and they murdered people there and now they claim to give a shit about riots and insurrection nobody believes any of their blatant hypocritical bullshit and everyone is sick of it the far leftists are not this stupid they are just totalitarian fascist,1

or they will try to convince everyone that 1984 has a happy end,1
does cancelling publishing deals count,1
i am not planning to what is the point if we are already living it,1
i watched the movie and thought that was very overrated but have not read the book was pretty funny though when the couple was talking and then some picture fell off the wall and the leader or whoever talking to them lol,1

they were about their free speech and expression they wanted the freedom to advocate for communism it was all about using our values against us it was never about open discourse freedom or exchanging idea,1

do not watch it the movie is crap read the book that is actually got the best arguments he is trying to mak,1
personally i find animal farm to make a bit of a finer point and it s a quicker read but they re both great,1
the movie is okay but the book is really great,1
it s a cool book you should read it,1
as a brit i m trying to hide my emotions but yh i think you guys are in major trouble especially if you don t conform and agre,1
yh even the constitution was in part inspired by the magna carter the u k isn t a bastion of freedom anymore there are some laws that have been brought in to change that and london alone has more cameras looking at the population that i think any other major city in europe i ve even seen politicians giving interviews and talking about vaccine certificates or qr codes on their phones to say you ve been given your vaccine i can t be sure on the whole but it seems the u k isn t paying attention to how much we are losing including recent reports about the police wanting the right to enter people s home during the pandemic to break up illegal gatherings it does seem like america is losing the fight and the worst part is that it s done to applause that is what freaks me out the most people are cheering it that is so messed up,1
someone explained that they think it s comfort we ve lived in a peaceful time in the west which some think has led us to become complac,1
i feel you brother just a few days back i got a dm calling me a fascist and comparing trump to hitl,1
they also like to ignore the fact that nazi was alang for national socialist party they werent even right wing the government people controlled the ecobomy and the means of production everyone had a job most got paid the same and it was socialism with a dash of nationalism for germany edit a dash of nationalism was a sarcastic remark they were extremely nationalist i know edit 2 socialism government control of all production a command economy universal and state run healthcare education amongst many other things they had a government that while fascist and horrible in every way was also socialist adding even more to their horr,1
i think it s to rationalize their animosity they know conservatives aren t nazis especially the top ones the elite rich democrats and party insiders they ve grown more and more vitriolic and it has to be rationalized somehow you can t be this blatantly hypocritical unless you establish a foundation of justification that s all the constant attacks and defamation are that way when it comes to actually silencing us it s easily portrayed as silencing radicals the sheep has no idea i graduated from a cal state this last spring trust me when i say my peers are some of the most ignorant people who consider themselves some of the most informed they have zero idea what the average republican or conservative believe only the caricature they ve been given,1
reminds me of witch trials oh maybe she was not never mind it is too late to care anyway neeeeext,1
this is like asking is it ok to punch a nazi,1
well america isnt germany the citizens were disarmed in that country its the first thing tyrants do,1

here i thought liberals did not like history turns out those fuckers been using history as a playbook,1
lol the brigading is real but yeah i completely agree hitler used it as an excuse to purge his political enemies and suspend civil liberties and he cemented his rise to power over it exactly what the dems are do,1
they are starting small and yes silencing conservatives is small compared to what the nazis did at first however again we have been labeled as such for 4 years so they will look at what they are doing as justifi,1

i think the problem is comfort people especially those whose idea of travelling is to go to resort hotels have no idea how hard to obtain and fragile civilisation is and how shitty life still is for many people particularly those without freedom property rights etc we have had a pretty good run for the last few years and so people think they have the luxury of destroying it all for their personal benefit and nothing will go wrong when the next historical equivalent of the 100 year war hits hope some of these wreckers are blamed rich venezuela to poor venezuela didnt take very long and the us is going to fall hard,1

all socialists are nationalistic historically like saying they are not ia being ignorant of history however the confusion comes when we compare the american right and left vs the rest of the world in america progressives are left and lean to communism while our super conservative right tends to be federalists with anti government views rest of the world their right is big government who lean conservative that is the fundamental isaue with arguing if they are right or left,1

also why so many people end up i such serious arguments on these internationally used board,1
the 1930s fight with the nazis was national socialist vs international socialism the russians were advocating for an international socialism that ignored national boundaries while hitlers tweak to the idea was to socialism would be extra awesome if the aryans were in charge but the political goals were very similar,1

naw instead of sneakers they got a few souvenirs out of the offices of members of congress and stole some camera equipment from the press and one guy apparently decided he wanted a podium for some reason either way you look at it storming the capital building is breaking the law and worse yet a police officer and an air force veteran lost their lives because of it trying to justify any of the illegal actions by saying the other side also does illegal stuff makes no sense just disappointing and a massive black eye for the political party that supports or pretends to support law ord,1

looks like they ll be more of a fight than i thought,1
for sure you stay safe as wel,1
souvenirs oh booo fucking hoo it is only a black eye because the media ignored blm and antifa riots last year calling them mostly peaceful but this riot will be used against use for the next 4 years and will also conveniently cover up any story having to do with election fraud which this whole thing is about excuse me if i am not just going to sit back and say ah fuck it i will wait to vote again in 4 year,1
theres some explanation here fantheories comments 1moua0 starship_troopers_buenos_aires_was_a_falseflag,1
you re looking at it from the wrong angle though it s the armed citizenry that is the stabilizing factor even in states where it s democrat there s still a large portion of people that are armed japan didn t invade the us for this very reason interestingly enough it s what won our counties independence to begin with,1
does that logic hold where there actually were those bugs out there attacking human worlds i dont remember the details if that had not happened yet til the humans attacked the bug first,1
as a brit i remember the day you americans wasted so much tea we still harbour for vengeance just biding our time lol that s probably true i ve heard there s three times as many guns in the us than people i can t see it all being just republican,1

does twitter have a hacked information policy or not guess not anymor,1
why would researchers release the actual data instead of just white papering the exploit,1
in a press release announcing the decision twilio revealed which services parler was using this information allowed hackers to deduct that it was possible to create users and verified accounts without actual verification with this type of access newly minted users were able to get behind the login box api used for content delivery that allowed them to see which users had moderator rights and this in turn allowed them to reset passwords of existing users with simple forgot password function since twilio no longer authenticated emails hackers were able to access admin accounts with ease twilio is going to get sued by parl,1
oh boy i brought this up a month or so ago telling people that parler asking for personal information such as a home phone number and or payment information was very questionable and that their database could get infiltrated thank god i did not sign up this should be a warning to anyone whatever the reason a website claims to get your person information do not join a simple email should be good enough they do not need your home phone number to verify your identity that is just fucking stupid and if they require personal information to validate your existence it probably was not worth it anyway parler is now an example i swear republicans are really getting woke during all this a few things we learned so far 1 your own conservative leaders are fucking you over and selling you out 2 you do not switch to a social media platform owned by infamous liberals like apple you go open source and sdks and yes it takes a while 3 never give your personal information such as phone number especially payment information for verification purposes 4 when protesting you should not follow people into a building that currently has cops surrounding it and politicians inside 5 what the fuck could possibly be next insert her,1

doxxing everyone who uses parler just for being conservative is gross,1
this is why i never got a parler you had to identify yourself the internet should be anonym,1
i signed up and used it for a bit then left guess i am fucked like an idiot i used my actual email address too i did not like it there i get the idea and support people trying but that place was just a mess,1
there were several things in that article that pissed me off but the opening sentence parler a social network used to plan the storming of the u s capitol last week this witch hunt is going to spiral out of control,1
leaked by security researchers yep this is 100 newskpeak,1
my instincts to stay off parler are paying off especially when they wanted all that personal information that was a hard nope for me also security researchers is pretty funni,1
security research,1
the entire government was hacked by russia and no one is talking about it,1
security research,1
what is amazing is that the criminal hacker who did this just openly brags about it on twitter like nothing will happen to her everything she stole is fruit of the poisoned tree she is both civilly and criminally liable for anything that happens to parler users as a result of her crim,1

is this why i got a weird fucking text message accusing me of being a trump supporter from an il area code edit also did this happen to anyone els,1
is this confirmed would not they just dump the data so people could go through it and see if their coworkers are on the list like with ashley madison some of the terminology in the article does not add up for ex he scraped crawled the site that is not hacking i scrape crawl the google search engine everyday they also used an api to enumerate user accounts once again not really hacking best they can do is use that list and try to guess passwords against those user accounts until more info is released sounds like this person just wants street cr,1
however alkhatib agrees that if the data scrape was targeted towards minority groups there d be a lot more to worry about racism is so in these day,1
and that is why i never use anything tied to me anymor,1

am i woefully ingnorant about parler i joined to see what is there this summer and it was kind of boring loads of aoc dumb and do not vote for communism meme type comments so i stopped scrolling through there i joined more as an f you to twitter than because i love social media did i miss some part where they are calling for assassinations or someth,1
if i did not work for my familys company i would be scared for my job right now this is disgust,1
uh huh leaked i knew this fucking shit was a honey pot thankfully i did not use the sit,1
security research,1
delet,1
damn i finally signed up a few days ago i was holding off because of the required phone numb,1
a conservative is paramount to being evil anymor,1
i have seen many people mention trump joined parler too just recently now i am not doubting it but did he ever post anything on it and if not where does the info come from,1
so they remove parler from apple and amazon and then they leak shit to scare everyone from ever coming back to it even if or when parler gains a new host sounds fucking familiar,1
fake new,1
the number of my personal friends i see celebrating this is having me seriously rethink some friendships by all means investigate those who planned any illegal activites on the platform but this is going to be used to paint anyone with a parler account as complicit we live in dangerous tim,1
so if i created an account never posted email and phone number only reset password one time what s my risk,1
this is a hoax,1
leaked ie another aws inside job by a rogue employe,1
the fact this article blames parler as the source for the planning of the assault on the capitol shows how shit this source is what absolute fucking propaganda,1
i dont think it was an accid,1
how are they security researchers if they leaked the data they are hackers and they are happy to compromise private data so long as it is the right people having their privacy viol,1
what did you expect this is the way leftists always work destroy what you cant control be ready for further atrocities of these freedom hat,1
ha thank god i stay away from social media besides reddit since its anonym,1
looks like parler is going to have a nice lawsuit to get some funds to make their own server spac,1
it is like order 66,1
researcher so if he works for our side an unregistered twitter account is a researcher but if the person works one of the other guys he is a hack,1
twillo will be the next company parler will name in a lawsuit and every user that had their info scraped can be a party to the suit,1
should i start changing my phone number fortunately i did not go so far as to get verified but i am concerned about my name email and phone number being out there for crazy people to dox me over what i really am asking is what can i do to protect myself and make myself less of target i have nothing to hide personally other than being a conservative american but that seems to be all it takes in this new world that resembles more of george orwells 1984,1
1984,1
i am right here are the gulags already in plac,1
wonder if this gonna help aoc make her list,1
great more calls offering me information about my warranty like i would buy some shitty toyota,1
research,1
ah so they took advantage of the chaos as the companies parlor was partnered with shut them down this was scummy are you all paying attention to how they can hurt you yet you don t need the fbi to come after you if they use companies to destroy your lif,1
this is fake new,1
apparently it is ok to talk about hacked materials so long as you do not show proof i e the actual docu,1
shitty part is people have to give them their social security number so a leak like this is not good at all edit it sounds like parler never asked people for ssns sorry for spreading that rumor,1
their only standards are double standards at this point,1
policy doesn t matter law doesn t matter nothing matters anymore except power that s what the democrats are teaching m,1
security researchers sounds less threatening they wouldn t accidentally leak something lol,1
because the data is basically meaningless look what was written twitter user donk_enby who first announced about the scrape claims that over a million video urls some deleted and private were taken they wrote a web scraper to pull all the posts and profile put up on parler because they were all public once you post something simply hitting delete or private does not secure it from the internet,1
ahhh whoop,1
real security researchers don t do that because it s unethical activists and lefty shitstains do that because revolution nothing less and their glorification infatuation with marx,1
they are hacktivists not researchers they want the data so they can report people to the fbi except they are basically just going to report anyone because they are wholly intolerant of people with differing opinions in what admittedly small time i spent on parler nobody was talking about insurrections violence or any other illegal activity most were basically just using it as a way to disseminate information there is no good intentions her,1
check her name a researcher inde,1
no it will not parlers lawyers dumped them too,1
how dare you speak logic to us ,1
i am sure many online services do thi,1
by law they are required to do this for up to a year it is just in case any kind of investigation has to be made against the person who deleted their account to hide criminal act,1
this is common because of future features like restoring posts and what not as a dev we often place flags that mark stuff as deleted instead of actually deleting it there are a bunch of reasons for it i m always in favor of deleting things for the record but sometimes there s reasons that we can t because of limitations in the way the software was developed or the way the infra i,1
you re a fool if you believe most web applications hard delete user data it s all soft delet,1
every online service does this they store it as deleted this is why you simply have to be careful about what you post in the first plac,1
others do this as well part of it is because you do not want to accidentally delete things that were not supposed to be i can tell you this definitely happens in live environments the main concern here is that the data was able to be accessed and how easily it seems to have been don,1
yeah that s really fucked up that s our data and if i want it deleted it should be gone that marketing saying always rings true if you ain t paying for it you re the product,1
thus where we are i asked on a post on another sub what people will do once they ve gotten every conservative fired from their jobs response i got was live peaceful l,1
it s turned into a witch hunt never thought i d see the day,1

welcome to why i am hesitant to make a gab or parler account this terrifies m,1
also there were not just conservatives on there lots of liberals and shills i was on there for my business acct i saved the user name months ago so no one would take only this month did i actually log on to see what is happening on parler all i posted was inspirational memes lol,1
it is ok they justified it by outright lying in the very first sentence of the article and saying parler was used to plan the storming of the us capitol who gives a shit about facts when it is so much easier to be angry and hateful to everybody who disagrees with the left,1
conservative holocaust is start,1
it should be illegal to doxx anyone i do not care who it is this country needs stricter privacy laws and very harsh enforcement of it,1
yellow stars man,1
doxxing everyone who uses parler you mean literal hitlers and nazis ,1
as if they weren t going to,1
you only had to if you wanted a verified badge you could use it without it,1
it was optional actu,1
in the article there is a link where you can see if your stuff was included in the leak,1
i did not care for it either i like the idea but it takes a large amount of participation to get good content my whole feed was just ted cruz post,1
we lost control when we became more concerned about views clicks and likes then we did actually presenting factual inform,1
the response is going to draw more support for radicals on both sides the whole thing is a mess,1
i liked it better when journalists didn t editorialize in every articl,1
then they should ban twitter a fringe site where low iq individuals spread disinformation to younger people who think their older counterparts know what the hell they are talking about,1
surely if parler doesn t moderate content and these people planned their riot on there then screenshots of this must be readily available has anyone seen them i have not this rallying cry of it was used to plan an insurrection can be filed under the if we repeat it enough it becomes true categori,1
they should call it a shaman hunt as that is more accur,1

if this goes by uncondemned then i would not be surprised if they do the same for this subreddit next,1
anything on twitter is now suspect damage control is so easy when you control all nothing to see here comerade walk away,1
exactly my thought,1
i feel like the act of enumerating user accounts is part of the research information gathering stage that goes into a hack does it only become hacking at the instant that you gain access,1
rape dungeon,1
rape cave lmao,1
same and i never saw anything calling for assassinations although i only followed news people and a few friend,1
new companies often have issues getting running and facing hackers but now there is the power of the leftist cabal to accelerate it does anyone here think that all their twitter facebook info isnt available to the chicoms already sellouts and betrayers thats why ive said that these companies have committed suicide watch the betrayals are just start,1
what did you give them all of it is leaked now,1
this is the way leftists do things by any means necessary is the leftists motto translate that as any crime need,1
besides reddit since its anonymous that is what you think doug i know it is y,1
they are literally linking to the hacked materi,1
like tax report,1
i never gave them that they have my phone number and email address but so does fb and twitter i think the big problem is that if you verified yourself as a real person you had to take a picture of your id typically a drivers license i never did that but i bet a ton of others did i did not trust it seems that was the appropriate cal,1
how did the whole ssn rumor get started i made an acct a week ago just to see what all the buzz was about and i never got asked for any personal info,1
i dont think this is a thing at least for people who are just creating accounts i made a parlor account specifically looking for it to ask for my ssn but it never did,1
no app ever should be asking for that why would you even think they ask for that in the first place have you ever seen an app do that in your entire lif,1
chose to not had to a fool and his personal info is soon parted bla bla bla,1
i did not have to give my ssn what are you talking about,1
security researchers is leftist speak for hack,1
yeah i am calling bs on parler being hacked sounds like script kiddie shit look at me i used curl or wget to mirror a website 31337 h4x0r,1
lol this i can imagine not a lot of people here are tech savvy but a web scraper is reality easy to build and can scrape public data on most websites this wasn t some sort of data breach not sure why im being downvot,1
that and parler is clunky and does not have a group function theres more organization in the live stream comment sections on youtube if the left truly believes that level of communication is sufficient for a national insurrection they will be actively sh tt ng themselves for the next 2 year,1
thank god there are more than 1 lawyer in the world,1
they got a lawsuit filed against aws today,1
i can assure you that there are lawyers who want a piece of twilio,1
i do not have the time to go to law school real quick and do it myself but surely there is a lawyer somewhere who is willing to take this on,1
i am sure a normal company can find a lawyer to represent them in this ridiculous case i am from a very litigious state and it is bs to act like parler cannot find a lawyer when i have seen for example a dude faking being disabled and suing lingerie stores for being handicap accessible find a lawy,1
even if dumped that is still a legit cause for a lawsuit,1
believe me there s always another lawyer when you pay your bil,1
they did but it would be naive to think given the merits of lawsuits they could direct against a number of major tech companies that they will be bereft of alternative counsel,1

i think several do when i was deleting a service that i no longer used in the past i asked them to not only deactivate my account but also remove my data they said they would not and after talking to a customer service person for a while they told me to just change all my personal info name email phone number to something else before i deactiv,1
it s pretty common users accidentally delete stuff then want it back ok fine we ll just flip the deleted flag it looks like parler was stupid and made the deleted content still accessible if you knew the url and also made the urls easy to guess by using sequential ids those are the real stupid parts of thi,1
oh that makes it perfectly okay then ,1
yes make sure that if you ever delete your reddit account that you use something like shreddit or similar that goes through and overwrites as much of your history as it can,1
they pretty much all do it is easy to just set a flag saying the account is dead and then never think about it again a proper delete involves lots of tables and can run you afoul of various subpoenas and other compliance laws like what happens when you realized you got hacked a year ago how do you inform the guy who deleted his account yesterday that his information was compromis,1
they all do,1
a year nothing is ever deleted folks the moment you hit save or submit it is recoverable by someon,1

i had parler for about two weeks to promote my music and then i got bored with it and deleted my acct,1
gab is fine all they wanted was an email address,1
this is true they did this as a verified status like the blue checkmark on twitter one problem though is their security sucked just like the app site did,1
except you need to supply a phone number to even sign up,1
the phone number part sure seemed mandatory it scared me right off i tried using a google voice number that i use for junk purposes but they rejected it,1

yeah i am kind of baffled by it i never really saw ssn prompts or driver license prompts i was curious to create an account months ago and pop my head around type of thing i have done that a lot for up and coming social media platforms if i get those prompts i nope the app and delete it,1
facebook does that shit too if your profile name comes into question or your profile gets reported too much for anything they just default to shutting you down til you provide an id,1
same here i was going to sign up a few weeks ago and that stopped me dead in my tracks they are going turn this into some sort of is your neighbor a terrorist tool you watch,1
i was verified as a real person and i did not have to do that,1
i honestly cannot remember if i took a picture like that or not if it was optional like you say i probably did not anyway i do not think i have much to worry about because i never said anything remotely extreme over there probably because i am not an extremist,1
id verification gets put into an irreversible hash to prevent duplication and the image is deleted literally deleted not flagged as delet,1
i think it is required if you want a higher account like an influencer or something but not just a regular account,1

this is the best course of action with anything online i have not seen it in awhile but occasionally you will come across comments on reddit where it states the user used some program service to overwrite all of their post,1
will not matter there are continuous archives being made daily of the entire comment database anyone who was sufficiently motivated could roll the whole thing back to any given date i still use nuke reddit history periodically though you should periodically start new accounts and lie about your life details or better yet concoct a consistent fake identity i have a whole fake narrative where i talk about being an old guy living in a city being married with kids etc,1

muahaha i will never reveal my method,1
wow and i thought a phone number was intrus,1
how ironic when most don t need id to vot,1
instagram does that too,1
thats what im concerned about,1
i would hope so i have not been able to dig into the details at the same time one would assume that a human at parler would have to look at the id image in order to verify otherwise you could take a picture of your dog and send that and therefore means i have to trust that parler hashes and actually securely deletes the image i do not have that level of trust with any tech company i would like to hear from parler about this and explain how they protect user data i have not had much time to look into this today other than what the hackers claim to have gotten so it may be that i am a bit behind the times if any new information has come out in the past few hour,1
i read that too but it never happened to me i never posted or anything though i was on the site for like 5 min,1
i made an account two days ago and it did ask for my email and phone numb,1
nope no phone numb,1
i joined and looked into it out of pure curiosity first off as long as you are not using a flagged ip address like a vpn you will not get the sms verification so i was able to join by just using a cellular network with a fake phone number and only had to complete a 6 letter captcha the identification part is a thing but only if you want to be validated sort of like a blue check on twitter they say it is used to validate and then delete i guess we will se,1

really sick of that fucking gasbag of a woman,1
too little too late for objectivity and honesty with the media they shown their bias when they kept bashing trump,1
i have to admit i am impressed with just how far nancy pelosi is willing to take her bullshit i have seen five and six year olds that can spin a lie for hours and hours and even they eventually come back around but nancy is on another level of lying what is really crazy though is that her voters are all in on the lie we are not talking a few thousand people like that waitress from the bronx we are talking tens of thousands of people that are either incredibly ignorant or completely willing to go along with the lie i always wondered how a lunatic like hitler could accumulate the power he had we are seeing it unfold first hand with the democrat parti,1
she was probably briefed that we are going to have to ask you a tough question but it will be mostly how bad trump is then they had ice cream and talked about their great grandchildren,1
it was the republicans faaaaaaaault is this the only thing they ever say when they get called out for their bullshit i don t think i ve ever seen a democrat admit that they dropped the ball even when they propped up one of the least likable candidates in history then ran her campaign horribly instead of just admitting that they fucked up they spent four fucking years pointing the finger at republican,1

friend of mine is a direct relative of pelosi she said after this year most of the family disowned her lol,1
1 i watched most of the interview and it is just a bunch of pearl clutching about terrorism but only because it is against them they also say american democracy is under siege by wanting votes counted properly democracy is under siege these two hags are insane if you watch it 2 stahl does not follow the news anymore she is barely preparing for interviews anymore watch her with trump she was completely unprepared for basic comebacks whether you agree with those comebacks is not the point she is like hunter avalone talking about politics but not knowing about the hunter biden laptop this hag needs to go,1

and it is so easy to tell when she is been caught like that,1
ooooooooof,1
anyone with half a brain should realize that she rejected a relief bill that was more than twice the size of the one she eventually got passed in congress she did not want to help people she wanted to let people suffer and let conservatives take the blame and as a result she lost 15 seats to republican,1
good for stahl,1
i can t believe the dems voted for this senile bag of bones to represent them again i can t wait for 6 months or so down the line when the dems realize they can t afford all of this free stuff they promised their constituents i wonder if the libtards and moderates will finally wise up then,1
she literally can do nothing other than just say any criticism or otherwise is the republicans fault the woman is disgusting as far as politics is concern,1
that is especially awful considering pelosi herself admits she did not get it pass,1
the crazy thing is that not even cnn and nbc are pushing that narrative wolf blitzer even famously grilled her a few months ago over her obstructions to federal aid she was simply there to prevent the trump administration from accomplishing anything positive https m youtube com watch v gqpltmpwiwo they literally just assume that anyone on their team is a good guy and anyone on the other team is a bad guy,1
these people are all over reddit it is insane trump begged democrats to pass a clean bill senate republicans begged democrats to pass a bill on what they agree on and get covid relief into the hands of americans this is fact it is in record there is no argument to be had trump senate gop asked democrats to pass a bill on the things they knew they agreed on aid for americans and leave everything else out pelosi refused and insisted on the pork filled bill with shit unrelated to covid,1
the media is going to try and pretend they are playing hardball with the dems for just a little while they always do this fight after they pretended nothing was going on see the hunter biden scandal that was russia until it was tru,1
i hear trump blocked covid relief all year trump did not want 1000 each hitler like yo you know that is not actually true right you get your news from a fat baby stelter brother of the worst and most corrupt governor in the world who just let millions of covid vaccines expire cuz he loves lockdowns and hates old people and is fascinated with eugenics cuomo and the most elitist piece of garbage on the planet lemon like bro you get your news from nominees for the biggest pieces of s on the planet who have been caught openly lying hundreds if not thousands of times you know a dude recorded the ceo of cnn openly manipulating the news for months check out brian okeefe project verita,1
i have legitimately encountered this on popular non political subs it s so frustrating need we remind them that pelosi s bill required extremely absurd stipulations such as 33 2 million for national oceanographic and atmospheric association climate change 100 million for nasa 100 million for construction and environmental compliance 300 million for the irs 35 million for jfk performing arts center 90 million for hiv assistance 36 million for national center for advancing translational sciences 7 million for a dc charter school 300 million for pbs 500 million for museum and library services 1 million pay raise for sergeant at arms and door chief of the senate 300 million for refugee and migration assistance mandatory diversity quotas for corporate boards in order to receive loans mandatory provisions to minority bank,1
well can you blame them how else are people supposed to get news other than the news once most of the countries media stops being agenda free it is fucked it is no better then having state controlled media,1
that s funny most people i know who are neutral on pelosi don t follow politics idk anyone who follows her and likes h,1
it is because she never admits what she did republicans will say yes we held up the bill because of major amounts of wasteful spending while pelosi just says nope never held it up not ever i have never held it up if she was truthful and would actually admit that she did and why she would not be speak,1
what confuses me is that there was even a debate question for biden asking if he would tell pelosi to move along with the relief bill yet everyone somehow forgot about that or elected to ignore it,1
coworkers who believe pelosi is a hero careful not to get fired if you disagree they are not worth your job,1
but the gop blocked it at every turn 100 why they kept adding all that pork they set those bills up so no republican in their right mind would vote for them because they wanted to play an optics game for the election you know i get setting yourself up for victory in an election is a big part of what a political party does but the democrats need to fess the fuck up and admit they played fucking games with suffering americans to work to get their boy into offic,1
ya and since they control the conversation they control what people perceive as truth and facts it really should be mandatory in high schools collages to read 1984 by orson welles speaking of which has anyone else noticed 84 or 1984 in video games movies tv ads etc the last year or so i m seeing it everywhere it s honestly it s the only reason i read the book a few months ago it s free with prime on audible right now just say,1
i think we work at the same plac,1
in the wise words of ms pelosi that s their tact,1

i do not think they can afford to find a new villain it is gonna be trump that is why they are trying to goad him so much right now probably hoping he will go on tucker carlson and start spilling state secrets or something so they can launch more investig,1
it will still be trump just like everything was still bushs fault during obamas run,1
most of the early flak seems to be headed in mcconnells direct,1
oh they will be caught up on trump for a while republicans in congress will get to duck the media machine for a little while long,1
us domestic terrorists who have a different tax policy than the democrat,1
the new villain will be biden so they can convince everyone he should go and harris pelosi should be the two in charg,1
i do not care if you are left right up down black white or purple a d r l g or i we all need to agree in this nation that senators and representatives seriously need term limit,1
and the fact that she is lasted so long in washington says a lot no one like her or maxine waters should be a politician or have the powers they have they are horrible peopl,1
it is easy to lie when you never get called out,1
it is starting to make sense why they keep focusing on trump even with a freaking week left they need that irrational hatred to take the focus off of themselves what is going to happen next week when trump is gone democrats actually getting called out for their bullshit ha just kidding i am guessing they will launch all sorts of investigations into the previous administration something we were told would be un american un democratic and borderline treasonous four years ago but they need to keep to hatred boil,1
they both accumulated the power they had have through media it is a truly powerful weapon,1
fascism a political philosophy movement or regime such as that of the fascisti that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader severe economic and social regimentation and forcible suppression of opposition it s pretty obvious which party holds race above all else which party is suppressing the opposition and which party is trying to kill the free market accuse others of what you are doing has never been tru,1
nancy pelosi is an elder lich,1
i watched the beginning of the 60 minutes interview last night and while i vehemently disagree with the violence at the capital she made it sound so harrowing yet the worst she could point out was a broken mirror and selfies with shoes on her desk current politicians seem to have forgotten the founding fathers concept of consent of the governed politicians think they are infallible and demonize any protestors both sides do it anti lockdown protests protesting closed meetings that should be open to the public protesting for justice wanting election transparency if enough people have had enough of your policies that they are in the streets on the steps of government buildings protesting then as politicians they need to reevaluate their policies but they are so convinced they are right and they dig in their heels and vilify the people the people who they work for,1
it was real satisfying wish it happened more frequ,1
it was a token expression of disagreement makes them sound even handed you did not hear pelosi make a rather inflammatory remark at the end and ms stahl just moves on in fact she says they are moving on movin on,1
the reporter is playing the role of controlled opposition she will ask the question as proof of her impartiality then spend the rest of her time subtly pushing people toward corrupt politician,1
they also say american democracy is under siege by wanting votes counted properly democracy is under siege which is what i hate hearing all you ever hear is our democracy is under siege or our free and fair elections are at stake its like they really do not understand why trump supporters went to the capital they believe there was not a free and fair election and that democracy is under siege its like open you are ears just to hear them out instead of calling them nazis fascist and terrorists you do not have to even agree with them to understand their position we are just hearing tons of multibillion dollar corporations echo the same shit as establishment politicians and its dystopian asf,1
democrats to a tee their whole existence is to project onto the other side pure evil,1
this was a fluke or a set up to ask when there is bigger things in the news so when called out later they can saw we asked h,1
problem is who is going to do the inpeaching or a 25thing of her it will have to be the american people themselves if anyon,1
increased blinking indicates nervousness according to body language expert,1
na because that was a set up remember evil witch dems never take responsibility for their act,1
means they are really afraid then dont worry the demlefties will put an end to that,1
i mean mitch fucked it up the last time but for months leading up to the election pelosi refused to put forth anything that was not a trillion dollar mess,1
yeah i have friends that think trump is awful yet pelosi would be a good president and cuomo has done a great job it is sick,1
bernie echoed those senti,1
no shes a career politician never attaches her name to anything that way she can blame everyone else if anything goes wrong in the futur,1
yup,1
i mean look at cuomo he s doing an astronomically bad job at handling covid and he s being laud,1
not saying that the spending isn t dumb or at least worth examining but that was just the basic spending bill to which the covid relief was attached the real question is why the gop was just going to pass all of that without a fight the answer of course is that the legislature is totally broken and they don t vote on anything individually anymore they each just approve each others pet projects on the dime of the taxpay,1
i am not against all of those points but goddamn why did that shit have to be on a relief bill for the people speak,1
i got hairy leg,1
cornpop always makes me laugh my ass off,1
look at what they did to sandmann and how much they were worked into frenzy over him they still despise that that kid to this day they have no trouble creating villains what they cannot afford to do is to go back to the normal pro trump era of news they are going to permanently shift over to cancel culture style of program,1
he will go on tucker carlson and start spilling state secrets so they can launch more investigations if trump did this he would be bagged and rendered to a blacksit,1
man the way they seamlessly transitioned from running themselves ragged talking shit about bush to absolutely kissing obamas ass is one of the first big things that made me stop trusting the news media i know dubya said some goofy shit but it was blatantly unprofessional and really made me see who owns them,1
nah it s cruz first,1

you forgot to put in right in the definition to absolve all leftist of all there similar,1
controlled opposition nobody wants me to support anything that solidifies injustice in this country pelosi if leslie stahl was a real reporter or journalist she would have jumped all over that one utterance instead she says let us move on nothing to see her,1
i know i am approaching the election the same way i approach work i want to dig into it and use logic not because i am so bright and enlightened but because if there is information to analyze i would rather analyze it than listen to people talk forever even some politicians i like ranted on and on in the hearings and i do not need all of that fluff i watched the wisconsin and georgia hearings i think when you take trump out of it and just listen to poll workers it is clear there are errors processing ballots why the hell is this such a dramatic politicized thing just because they are afraid some results might get reversed i know they know there are issues because when pushed they give some version of well it happens all the time so does not matt,1
not 1 trillion but i believe it was 3 1 trillion she went long on covid,1
it should have been a stand alone bill not in the omnibus but mitch did fuck everyone on it,1
and never forget the first round of checks was tied to legislation mandating vote by mail,1
yeah i don t doubt mitch is equally as corrupt and awful but for this instance there s a difference between not wanting to provide people more relief and blocking it and intentionally letting people suffer to use for an election that s some psychopathic shit,1
tbh i think mitch just doesn t want the work that comes with being majority leader he is relatively old and has another 6 more years left in his term i imagine he wants to keep the benefits afforded to him by his position but doesn t want the extra work it s really sad b c the only group hurt by this are the american people the same goes for nancy chuck and all the other old school politicians currently in offic,1
every one of these bills is a mess the last one with 600 going to americans and billions going to stupid special interest shit like gender studies in pakistan and the kennedy center what any of that has to do with covid i don t know if these ass hats could pass a bill without all the pork it would be an amazing feat even in this time they can t just pass a bill for the american people without throwing billions at idiotic special interest shit,1
cuomo has done a great job if his goal was to murder nursing home patients and not distribute the vaccine while winning an emmi,1
well if cuomp was president we would not worry about our elderly relatives getting sick because they would all be dead,1
yep media narrative is powerful for all the damage to the trust of the media it is still incredibly effective in shaping narr,1
every piece of legislation should be a clean bill any major bill the pass now is full of bs provisions and enough pork to feed the cities of cleveland and atlanta for a year,1
listen fat wanna do some push up,1
i think setting term limits would help to solve that problem too though because the only way you get to be that goddamned old in politics is by having a death grip onto your seat for decades and decades i do not think you see too many 70 year old 1st term congressmen and senators as for the presidency that is tricky because you generally do not have the kind of clout to have a shot at the white house until you are older hence why the youngest president ever was still jfk i am not knocking elderly people but i feel like the stresses and responsibilities of the office of potus should mandate an age cap trump was old when he was elected and we indeed got a wily old coot but damn bidens age is fucking absurd,1
r exists in california but sure as fuck not in nancy pelosis congressional district,1
there are millions of republicans in california but cities like la and san francisco have such a stranglehold on the state that it s rare for a republican to ever be elected to a state offic,1
im doing my part,1
and there was a lot of money that was going to bail out states with dumbass governors like california and new york edit a word,1
she should have pulled a harry reid when he got called out on putting out the lie that mitt romney had not paid taxes in 10 years after the election he just shrugged and said it worked did not it same thing here the tactic worked and they completely got away with it,1
yeah i think mcconnell was blocking the last one out of the principle of it is dangerous to excessively print your currency to make up for economic problems pelosi was 100 adding as much pork as possible to stimulus bills to force the gop to block them for the sake of improving election optics that is bullshit,1

well it is only us that sees the media as untrustworthy the left many of my friends think trump has brainwashed us to not trust the media becuase he is a nazi i try to tell them actually i distrust the media cause i listen to trump speak for instance he says the sky is clear and blue today and it is then i turn on cnn and they report that he said the sky is pink and we should eradicate minorit,1
biden is going in a year older than trump is leaving and biden says he wants 2 terms what he wants and what he gets will likely be different but the man is saying he still wants to be president at 86 years old 86 biden couldn t handle the campaign trail how is he going to handle international summits lack of sleep when major events pop off 20 hour days for weeks on end etc the presidency is not an easy job and it is not for the feint of heart an age cap 100 is needed for both congress and the presidency i m not saying a cap of 50 years old but we shouldn t have an 80 year old in either spot presidency id say 75 probably the same for congress,1
got a feeling the stimulus they push through on 1 21 will probably be in the 6t rang,1
i remember that and you have to almost admire the honesty if anything this shows how pathetic mitt romney is for cowering to those that treated him so vici,1

who cares about a petition though,1
i m still wondering why russia helped trump win in 2016 but not in 2020 wait you don t think,1
a petition seems more reasonable than an attempted coup,1
sorry the memory of the screams of agony from the police officer that was being crushed into a door by a mob shouting heave ho as they were breaking into the capital to threaten my elected representatives is too fresh but wow signing a petition that is way more extrem,1
to be fair they didn t riot after the results a lot of them wanted to and many wished they had but they didn t actually try to get their way with forc,1
a civilian signing a petition is not the same thing as a president going to court keep up,1
and then those 5 million people went and stormed the us capitol building when they did not get their way oh wait,1
remember when nearly 5 000 000 people signed a petition to overturn the election in 2016 ummm i was not even aware that happen,1
and then everyone involved was banned from all of the internet and humanity i remember it so wel,1
yes let us pause and remember how 5 000 000 patriotic citizens used their first amendment rights to sign a petition in peaceful protest and compare that to today when sore losers staged a violent coup in a failed attempt to destroy our democracy thank you for pointing out how dissimilar these events ar,1
in hind sight we see what they were concerned about still trump won in 2016 and took office as he should what he did with it lead to his defeat in 2020 now we move on,1
did any of them break into a federal building and try to kill members of congress,1
they did not raid the fucking capitol,1
if we keep pausing the dems will keep winning time for the gop to wake up and realize that trump destroyed our party not the dems liberals blm no trump destroyed it,1
let us pause and remember when participants at a republican rally beat a cop to death,1
because the popular vote was not for the one who was declared the winner also after that you heard no more of that no obama screaming fraud no propaganda and ofcourse no storming the fucking capitol,1
because 5 million signatures is exactly the same as invading a federal building vandalizing stealing and disrupting legal federal operations everyone knows those are the sam,1
but that was totally different someone tampered with the results i know there is proof because i read it on reddit,1
did they storm the capitol and murder a cop,1
because he lost the popular vote by a lot,1

posts like these are why this subreddit has a bad name who cares if someone signed a petition that is not a federal crime that is freedom of speech that is literally what this country is about storming a federal building while chanting that you want to hang an elected official is insane and illegal don t spend so much time trying to point fingers and make excus,1

did they storm the fucking government force their way in smear shit on the walls beat a cop to death and then get started on plan 2,1
and then those 5 million stormed the capital and attempted a coup,1
signing a petition storming the capitol,1
no one stormed the capitol that time though,1
at least they only signed a petition and didn t storm the capital and kill a cop,1
let us also remember when none of them at the urging of obama stormed the capitol threw racial slurs at capitol police killed one and smeared feces on the wall get the fuck out of here with your false equivoc,1

did any of those petition signers do shit like this https pbs twimg com media erwihhuw4aaixjr format jpg name medium,1
yes because signing a petition and storming the capitol to stage a coup are the same thing smh,1
because trump lost the popular vote in 2016 that s why it was petitioned to be overturned actual facts he lost the popular vote again his followers want it overturned anyway but instead of having facts they have baseless conspiracy theories and instead of petitioning they organize a terrorist attack on innocent peopl,1
a petition is a little different than a terrorist attack on the nations capital trying to justify an attack like that is a pretty bad look,1
but like did they threaten to hang mike pence and murder members of congress another online petition is literally the least threatening thing anyone could do to another person lol,1
theres no way to overturn americas election russia interfered by troll farms and bots in a misinformation campaign see fbi report,1
lmao it was a petition not a coup attempt,1
sure people have the right to protest election results actually to protest any government policies they oppose at the same time anyone who burns shops or destroys public property should be prosecuted since trump won there have been many women s marches opposing his administration as long as they are peaceful i have no problems with them,1
anybody di,1
but they didn t storm the capitol lmao,1
no one thought the election was fraudulent when that petition was signed they were tired of winning the popular vote but losing the office thanks to the antiquated electoral college there s a huge difference her,1
it is a little embarrassing to see fellow conservatives who claim to be patriots but do not understand how america works petitions are okay attacking the capitol is not okay i feel like you do not need a law degree to understand that much,1
last i checked their was not any insurrection with thos,1
true but no one attacked a federal building and attempted to take hostages edit or plant bomb,1
remember when they stormed the capital also geez what a way to bring down the other side after the events of last week,1
riddle me this why were the rep senators only objecting to the presidential election when they won on the same ballot they all could have resigned and said they don t agree with the election result,1
we should also pause to note that hillary clinton did not take part in that petition or allege fraud donald trump did allege fraud in 2016 though he failed to produce any evidence then either oh he also alleged fraud when obama was elected no evidence that time eith,1

ah yes i remember the time hillary supporters stormed the capitol building with tactical weapons and flex cuffs this is clearly the same thing people will sign a petition for anything they remotely believe although there was evidence of russia making fake facebook groups to spread pro putin propaganda there was no connection to trump it went through the democratic process and it was dropped as it should be this election fraud shit has gone through the process in 20 different courts and caused our capital building to be over run had they just signed a petition 5 more people would still be al,1

at least they didn t storm the capit,1
im surprised this isnt on flaired users only already all the other top posts are lol,1
as dumb as this was it is not even remotely comparable to what we just witnessed last week fuck off with this shit,1
by now pointing out dem hypocrisy is just superfluous they don t care and their big media propaganda is going to run cover so they can take whatever stance they want in the mo,1
conservative logic signing a petition that literally does nothing violently storming the us capitol this is extremely simple both are acts related to try to overturn an election yes however one is a passive performative act that a bunch of millennials did from their couches while the other was a legitimate physical assault on our nation s capital so sure they exist on the same spectrum but benchmark them for the love of god put them on a scale signing a meaningless petition would be maybe score a 1 10 on the let s overturn the election scale violently attacking dc would be a 10 10 stop trying to deflect accept it was wrong and move forward enough with the whatabout,1
waaaaahhh waaaaaah democrats signed a petition that went nowhere which is somehow equatable to republicans sieging the fucking capital the braindead idiots on this sub somehow,1

oh no a petition thats almost as violent as actually attempting to forcefully overthrow the govern,1
call these people what they are insurrectionist,1
ooooohhh they signed an online petition with as little power as it comes remember the dead officers because of those protest,1
i am glad that we rightfully made fun of them for their hysterics at the tim,1

pause to remember how many of those people stormed the us capital arm,1
did 5 000 000 people march on the capitol with the intent of killing political opponents to overturn the election in 2016,1
yes how quickly they forget or ignor,1
i remember the petition after hillary won the popular vote and then i remember of the four years giving trump a chance until a week ago when his supporters stormed the capitol in an act of terrorism amid a 10 month pandemic that has crippled small businesses nationwide and was a total failure of the executive branch,1
if only maybe we would be in this fucking mess you all are snowflakes 1 pump trump was an absolute failure if only we could have overturned 2016,1
yes and democrats stormed the us capitol how did i forget that,1
5 million signed a petition and you are trying to compare it to a violent deadly coup attempt,1
all that this does is prove that there are stupid members of the public on both sides the real issue is that trump and many republicans kept up a charade that somehow congress was going to override the electoral votes and award trump the presidency this is what led to the insurrection at the capitol all this because they couldn t document any real cases of fraud and lost 59 court cases trying to change the outcome in fact the only valid arguments that they had in the end where that in some states like pennsylvania election parameters were changed by someone outside of the legislature nefarious things like allowing extra days for ballots to arrive do to the problems at usps yes it is true that the democrats have contested electoral college votes but as far as i know in each of those cases the democratic candidate had already conceded the election and there was no effort to change the results trump also claimed voter fraud in the 2016 election that he won because his ego couldn t comprehend that he had lost the popular vote there was a committee led by republicans that claimed to find fraud but could not provide any data to back it up https apnews com article f5f6a73b2af546ee97816bb35e82c18d,1
interesting move signing a petition like some sort of civilized person if i were them i would have forced myself into the capitol and beat a police officer with an american flag the patriotic way,1
based on most of the comments here i can see why most posts are for flaired users only looking forward to getting mine no this is not the same as what happened in dc but there were also more riots then,1

yeah exactly all the talk of not my president and people like clinton saying that it was not on the level or something absolutely sets a precedent and for everyone commenting about an attempted coup maybe that has something to do with the covid lockdowns and people being literally denied the ability to work with no compensation which is theft plain and simple unconsititut,1
the amount of nasty and rude private messages i got for posting this link is astonish,1
nothing in my post mentions the riot at the capital nothing the post simply shows that immediately after trump won the election liberals tried to overturn it when republicans challenged the results liberals mocked them it is a complete double standard the riots at the capital are a different issue but let us face it it is been 4 years of liberal rioting so i am calling hypocrisy on that too,1
did they storm the capitol too,1
remov,1
i mean it is a bit different to attacking the capitol,1
wow i had no idea it was that many insan,1
online petitions violent coup attempt on the capitol build,1
oh shit i cannot believe this is real you mean democrats only signed a petition i wonder what more they could have done to try and overturn a free and fair elect,1
less than 2 of the population signed to overturn the result last time now it seems 40 want to i assume some percentage of the right thinks this is a bad idea good on them there is a difference even when we ignore all current context people cry out censorship and double standards but they fail to notice what is actually different it is not hard to point out hypocrisy when you get to cherry pick the best version of an argument out of a massive group of people news flash that strategy literally always works with large groups of people dems republicans rich poor etc that is not a good argument that is a strawman this sub is filled with stuff like wow libs advocate for x but hate y how do they not see the hypocrisy when you get to make their argument for them that argument will always look stupid if literally half the country disagrees with you they have some ground to stand on acting like they do not is what makes our current political situation worse and while everyone here is freaking out calling censorship next time you see a leftist calling for violence on twitter report him and watch in shock and amazement when the tweet gets remov,1
you dipshits sparked an armed insurrection and you are complaining about a fucking petition lol if we are playing whatabout remember that time a governor helped his brother win an election by stopping a recount i suppose you folks think that your national popular vote problems are recent maybe try moderating a little bit so you can actually win elections i am sure this will get deleted but you gotta do better then winning the popular vote once every 20 year,1
this is exactly why the electoral collage needs to be modified for number of states jurisdictions won rather than awarding specific points to certain areas or a popular vote it would better represent the true political landscape and population distribution of the united states california should be balkanized as well into a minimum of 2 states and eastern oregon should be given to idaho,1
the thing is we conservatives can remember it the problem is the media isnt going to make the uninformed voters aware hence why they get away with caloing ut unprecidented it truely is sad,1
so if in 2016 the elections could not be overturned with a petition signed by 5 mil people why would it be a posibility now,1
it is perfectly fine when they do it sheesh sorta like pelosi encouraging more violence over the summer doing nothing about blm antifa riots and looting etc,1
if lefties did not have double standards they would have no standards at al,1
conveniently nobody in the media remembers 2016,1
wow i had no idea that was even a thing back in 2016 to be fair though i was not too thrilled about either choice we had that year so i just kind of voted and went about my days hoping whoever got it would do at least a half decent job and we would have better choices next tim,1
but we cheated the election also elections cant be ch,1
i was just looking into this because of a post on my local subreddit calling out local reps that voted to overturn the electorate turns out many reps voted to overturn the 2016 election and failed and nobody called for their removal that i can find at least 1 rep voted to overturn bush s victory as wel,1

signing a petition vs storming the capitol hmmm,1
a petition is a request not an insurrect,1
just as effective as storming a government building and killing people right,1
it s hilarious to see both sides claim double standards for some reason everyone on reddit political subs are using the same arguments against each other i really have no point but at least there is still one thing in common among people lol,1
party a does action 1 that is considered not good party b doesn t like it later on party b does action 2 that is also not good in fact worse party a doesn t like it party b justification party a did it already even though we didn t like it then no one is the winner here party b should have been better and just not did the bad things then they could be like see we don t act like party a did when they did action 1 this boils down to two wrongs don t make a right i m sure there is some bible crap out there like that too,1
it is an online petition that anyone can create for any reason it means nothing hillary was not calling on her followers to march on the capitol to protest it nor did she claim she had won the election the russian investigation was never about insinuating trump did not win it was about russia using social media to influence voters and whether or not trump was complicit in that action or not,1
cool how many stormed the capital how many represented voted against certifying the elect,1
a change org petition oh man what a rebuke to voters get ready for at least the next 12 years of dem rule you all earned it,1
they were right though trump is clearly unfit to serve so theres that,1
down the memory hole probably only a handful of people who would even admit that,1
yeah signing a petition and raiding the capitol with a mob truly the same th,1
remember when it was all petitions and not rioting trying to find the vice president to kill him remember when it was all petitions and orange man bad and not killing police remember when it was actual reports by credible people and not unhinged senile cracked lawyers and twitter fake news yeah i remember the days of petitions sigh,1
i have a question if trump and his lawyers did not have any proof then why would not the dems push for it to got to trail to completely humiliate the claim kinda like let them hang themselves so to speak to me it looks like a lot of speculation either way i do not trust our government no matter which side is holding the bal,1
huh kind of like people knew trump would be a bad presid,1
the problem as i see it is that the conservative vote has essentially been split you have republicans i would say the majority of people in this sub and what i call the america first party i call this new party america first instead of just trump supporters because i believe while trump instigated this split it will also live and grow beyond them you can see some republican politicians already courting their vote guys like ted cruz i do not agree with conservatives on a fundamental level but to lump them in with this massive group of lunatics i call the america first party would be wrong imo that is the rub for the republican party their voting base has effectively been cut in half so what do you do do you distance yourself from the lunatic conspiracy theorists who just attempted a coup and lose their vote or do you stand with them and lose the vote of every day conservatives who absolutely do not stand with the crazies the problem is they are not a fringe group of people who is vote is pretty irrelevant it is tens of millions of people and growing i can also see the democrat vote being split too sometime in the future but with progressives breaking away from more establishment leaning dems like your bidens and whatnot,1
interesting note that this site does not check signatures so it is entirely possible that many are fak,1
and rioted violently to try and achieve that objective it was encouraged by the media back then because they were so embarassed and angry that trump won they literally condoned violence honestly i know that the electoral college has voted in biden that is just a fact but the truth is after that humiliation they suffered in 2016 i just would not be surprised if the media bigtech the democrats all united to do absolutely anything to win 2020,1

each one of these people need to be banned from the internet for supporting a coup,1
breaking news 5 million people bought into right wing propaganda,1
we launched an investigation you attacked the capitol,1
yeah let us also remember that the people that signed that petition did not breach national security and loot the capital build,1
did hillary address the protesters telling them to march on the capitol did she tell them not to show weakness that they would only retake the country with strength did she claim she had actually won the election did she claim the election was rigged _even before people even voted_ did she insinuate that if she lost that meant that the election was rigged did she file dozens of lawsuits nationwide trying to overturn the elections did obama call a secretary of state to pressure them to overturn the results these comparisons are embarrassing you are only deceiving yourselves want to point out hypocrisy by the democrats go ahead we love doing that from the left as well but none of that can erase what happen,1
yeah i remember when they showed up to a riot with guns bombs molotovs and nooses got whipped into a frenzy by hillary stormed the capitol and brutally beat a cop to death oh wait i am sorry but the backlash to trump being elected was not comparable to what happened on wednesday frankly what happened on wednesday proves that it was not entirely unjustified eith,1

the people who signed it,1
maybe russia did help trump but china helped biden therefore proving that china is better than russia ,1
too busy with covid this year ,1
delet,1
no it can t be you couldn t possibly be saying that that it was a hoax peddled by the left,1
there s actually many possible reasons for that if they thought trump would be a valuable ally in 2016 but by election season 2020 it turned out he didn t advance putin s causes as much as was expected which he certainly didn t then the russians would be less apt to interference and ad posting likewise is the idea that putin is a fairly raging misogynist and that his hatred of hillary specifically led to a lot of interference and her lack of presence turned him away from american politics he may just have not seen a need or was expecting results favorable edit for everyone saying the russia stuff was fake it s true there was no collusion between the trump team and russia but that doesn t mean russia didn t try to influence the election in certain ways they did try micro targeting propaganda efforts at specific counties and areas that would shape the electoral election but the results of that are very inconclus,1
do you really think russias goal was to get trump elected their goal was to weaken the us by sowing division among the domestic population and between america and her allies and fomenting chaos trump was merely the opportunity that came along for them to do that in 2016 that meant helping get trump elected which the us ic determined they did after exhaustive analysis of russian activity covert and overt in support of trumps campaign in 2020 it meant sowing disinformation about covid 19 and election security and then amplifying the presidents lies about election fraud trump was always the means never the end,1

that would imply some sort of loyalty to trump while i m admittedly ignorant to the extent of russian interference it would be naive for someone to think that putin s main goal was a trump victory interference in the us elections was to discredit the voting process disrupt the political landscape destabilize the nation if putin thinks bernie sanders would accomplish that i m sure he d have no qualms about pushing him as hard as he can,1

you realize theyve had russian trolls on basically every platform advocating for trump right they have been doing that crap for 6 years social media has actively had to moderate it they have literally slipped up and released locations on posts from russia most of them cannot even form complete sentences but neither can a vast amount of trump supporters as it is hard to tell the difference at times someone with broken english posting from russia about support for trump and hate for the left you do not think hmm people within the program have had interviews about it every counter intelligence division we have has confirmed it they have massive govt sanctioned operations to disrupt foreign politics not just ours but several other nations as well they have hacked into nuclear sites they are generally just causing chaos and its working obviously a bunch of dumbfucks just stormed our own nations capitol you do not for a second think that they had a hand in encouraging people to go ape shit if you do not you are incredibly naive using trump and his oddly dedicated base is the best way to cause chaos here all they need is to poke at peoples misplaced h,1
russia aiding the trump campaign and trump colluding with russia are two entirely different claims one is true with verifiable evidence and the other was an unfortunate conspiracy theory being peddles by rachel maddow et al it is known that pro trump bots were created by several organizations one of which was the kremlin to spew pro trump language and even organize trump back the blue events accross the us just my opinion it is not hard to see these bots conspicuously posting auto generated crudely written content on twitter they look like textbook neural network gan english content that is pretty simple vague and not very meaningful or related to what it is replying to for example on a tweet discussing say big tech you will ser a reply saying president donald j trump is the best president of my life time maga kag for four more years these types of random unrelated replies are the ones i suspect of being bots but thats just speculation why is this so controversial to accept btw to be completely fair i do not doubt there are similar organizations doing the same thing for democrat,1

it is because they hated hillary not because they liked trump some conservatives are just braindead or cannot read articles or something fuck conservatives talking conspiracy about shit they know nothing about,1
just think about it russia wants to cause as much divide and chaos in the us as they can and tell me what other president than trump has divided the country more than ever it makes perfect sense and there were russian bots posting propaganda online that were found,1
for the same reason the u s will sometimes help rebel forces take down the leadership in countries where they installed said leadership they outlived their usefulness and or purposes and the power changing causes a void and chaos they found more promising if russia helped trump it s more than paid off in the long run they have slowly be filling the power vacuum america left because trumps america first policies example taking bases we built as their own in the middle east,1

trump did enough damage and weakened the us so much that putin is now satisfied that s why no help this tim,1
the russians helped trump in 2016 and not in 2020 because they want to create division between the left and the right so they can destroy our country alternating between trump to biden is a good way to alienate both sides from each other also the left is wrong when they say russia changed votes they only influenced public opinion,1

well spoken singing a petition vs actual violence an attempted coup sedit,1
comparing last week to an online petition that you sign up for via email is quite a stretch,1
and hillary did win the popular vote and they stood on that ground it was more of a petition to the electoral college to change which was never going to happen than to say the election was a fraud and biden didnt really win there is quite a difference in both and one thing is when people decide to do things on their own it is very different when the government and the party supports it people can do crazy and stupid things all the time its different when your leader happens to be the presid,1

this overgeneralization needs to stop same with using they and us like 30 conservatives out of how many millions rioted so we rioted i don t even know if those people were conservatives or just wanted an excuse to riot,1
no but they peddled conspiracy theories for 4 years on main stream media outlets and failed to condemn months of rioting and looting over the last year i agree what happened last week was horrible and should be roundly condemned but to act like what happened in 2016 did not contribute to raising the temperature in our political climate is bullshit if what happened last week is domestic terrorism then so were the blm and antifa riots of 2020 violence and intimidation to achieve a political goal we as conservatives need to be better than all this and condemn what happened while also reminding those of what happened to get us here hillary clintons reaction to her 2016 played a huge role in normalizing this kind of destructive behavior,1
liberals definitely rioted after the election it wasn t all pink vagina hats and old woman screeching into the ski,1
but according to all the memes only leftists riot and protest when they don t get their way,1
waiting for you to be silenced because you re not a flared user on their free speech forum,1
remember when nearly 5 000 000 people signed a petition to overturn the election in 2016 ummm i was not even aware that happen it was that important smh,1
didn t fit the narrative at the tim,1
how about jill and joe and bernie going state to state to demand recounts 2016,1
delet,1
let us pause for 3 seconds and list the names of elected officials that supported the overturning of the 2016 election result,1
a major difference is despite people being butthurt clinton gave a concession speech she didn t scream fraud for months whilst not conceding then tell thousands of followers to march to the capitol and kill a police officer and force congress to back down and make her president she didn t tell biden as vice president to basically ignore all this voting stuff and just announce that she is president imagine how completely insane the right would have gone if she tried that that is what is happening right now except the shoe is on the other foot,1
yes because signing a petition is the same as literally storming the capital beating someone to death and bring in pipe bombs and zip ties to execute politician,1
well let us be real back then there was not a coup involved that killed police officers the losing party was not quoting hitler and intelligence agencys found evidence for russian tampering this year there was not found anything and all the proof proved to be garbage made up by trump and friends trump and friends also agitated the crowd this time and he even said that he loves the terrorists his daughter called those terrorists murdering police patriot,1
and then everyone involved was banned from all of the internet and humanity i remember it so well that is what happens when you stage a coup as a domestic terrorist,1
and then they stormed the capitol building killed a cop threatened senators and the vice president and five died in the process oh wait,1
yeah because signing an online petition and attempting a violent coup leading to 5 deaths are the same th,1

and literally beat a cop to death,1
i am old enough to remember when thousands of leftists occupied the hart senate building and tried to breach the supreme court,1
it annoys me that it requires a riot which has led to the deaths of several to get in the way of installing their dnc man as president before they condemn it to me it feels like it wasn t about the fact there was blood spilled in the capitol it was about the fact that they thought they wouldn t be able to certify the count that s the only reason anyone s still talking but who knows maybe i m just delusion,1

the scene on friday night described by a person with firsthand knowledge kicked off an uneasy weekend at the white house as demonstrations spread after the brutal death of a black man in police custody under a white officer s knee while in the end officials said they were never really in danger mr trump and his family have been rattled by protests near the executive mansion that turned violent for a third night on sunday i dont know man this sounds a little different to me you know why people make fun of us because half of us are being intellectually dishonest whataboutist fucking cunts right now in response to actual sedition this is insane you are going to push people away from having any remotely fathomable conservative ideas ever again acting this way,1
they did not try to breach the whitehouse they were standing outside protesting also they are doing renovations on the original gate so there is another fence that is like 200 ft from the original gate and it stands like 12ft tall you can barely even see the whitehouse from behind it no one was climbing or even violently shaking the fence either what they actually did was post their protest signs to it and keep it moving this is no where near comparable to what happened last week also did not trump say he was only in the bunker to check it out or someth,1

you are comparing blm protestors near the whitehouse to protestors marching straight from the presidents rally to capitol hill and immediately storming the place blm protestors did not even try to enter the white house what are you talking about there is no evidence they attempted to breach the white house apart from that one protest was for the life of minorities the other was to act on a proven lie in during what seems like a very poor attempt at a coup comparing the two is equivalent to trying to rewrite histori,1

exercising their first amendment right to petition the government ask electors to change their vote is not the same as taking over the united states capitol stop the false equival,1

california,1
there is nothing worst to a healthy democracy than signing a petit,1
give it a couple of years any dissent from the position of the democrats will be seen as treason,1
how is this equivalent in anyway holy shit man try to use your brain,1
it is a false equivalency it would have been the same if obama sitting president and a few senators used the power to back it it would have been the same if obama organized a demonstration and participated in it and ask them to go to the white house and do a trial by combat then obama did not welcome trump to the white house did not go to the inauguration etc moreover the police and federal officers open the doors of the white house to protestors and so on and so on one is an idiot in his house complaining and the other is taking action it is like you compare an idiot screaming i will kill you with a guy that killed and got caught on the cctv disclaimer i am liberal and don t like him also i think banning him and his supporters must not be in hands of silicon valley guys edit for a few mistak,1
are you really comparing an online petition with an event that led to the storming the capitol building and beating a cop to death,1
what double standard please explain how a petition is identical to a terrorist attack,1
can you tell how they changed them and how it was unconstitut,1
that s why we need to get rid of the electoral college 1 person 1 vote let the popular choice win,1
honestly i feel like this particular point would have been more effective if there was a big deal made about all states that did it by making it only about this issue in swing states it hurts the narrative significantly you did not hear shit about new york tennessee mississippi florida ohio etc i agree that many were changed unconstitutionally but a we are in a pandemic we cannot act like these states just made changes for no reason and its all business as usual and b i think trumps point would have been far stronger if he made the point about literally every state that made changes to their election laws this way instead of the ones that he needed to win i get that an approach like that practically requires more resources and does not necessarily help a win but you get what i mean focusing on the swing states only makes it feel like he is just trying to win and not call out states for setting bad preced,1
clearly an attempted coup ans signing a petition is the same thing ,1
apparently op finds online petitions a threat to democracy equal to bringing molotov cocktails to the capitol,1
early and mail in voting was more prevalent than in 2016 which has less security and vulnerable to ballot harvest,1
because they thought hillary was going to win,1
starting an online petition is an insurrection that is quite a stretch,1

i think liberals continue to poke around in this thread to look for signs of intelligent life given the uh extreme nature of recent events i know i am personally lurking in hopes of finding some signs that conservatives have realized things on that side of the aisle have gotten out of hand i would love for a return to actual discourse over the merits and flaws of liberal vs conservative values but conservatism has been aggressively hijacked by fascists trump has galvanized the extreme elements of the right and left in a powerful way and it s as embarrassing as it is dumbfounding he s not a bastion of conservatism are you a conservative or a trump supporter it s not the same th,1

first the issue is the presuem collusion second that is not the conclusion to be drawn there early on that appeared to be the case yet we found out the russians tried and failed to hack the rnc we learned that the steel dossier was predominantly made up of russian misinformation directly from russian intelligence as in what the left and the fbi did was play as useful idiots for russian intelligence the only meaningful conclusion is that russia was not attempt to influence the election they were attempting to sow discord and only one party played along with it hint democrat,1
the hoax was that the trump campaign actively colluded with russia to interfere in the election the hoax was that any of this interference actually flipped a single vote towards trump the hoax was that there was sufficient grounds to overturn the election and trump was somehow a russian stooge all peddled by mainstream media and then they did what you are now doing russia made some social media sites to try and help trump along proof we were right no you were raving lunatics clinging to any shred of evidence that might help your caus,1

there is no mechanism in our constitution to redo a federal election if the election was deemed illegitimate and congress did not come to a conclusion as to what to do in the coming months considering they cannot agree on anything that is likely the presidency would go down the line if succession thus we would have the current speaker of the house be active presid,1
imagine if clinton had been recorded on the phone telling democrat state legislators to give her enough votes to win the state imagine she refused to concede imagine she kept saying there was fraud but didn t offer any proof in court and kept getting her case kicked out imagine clinton kept on telling her supporters to fight against the fraud she couldn t prove existed imagine she told vice president biden at the time to make her president despite losing the vote imagine clinton after being rebuffed called biden a traitor because he was following the constitution imagine she gathered thousands of followers and pointed them at the capitol telling them to go and change the mind of congress to fight imagine 5 people died that day instead what you got was concession president trump and investigations where evidence was presented after the fact it s not even close to compar,1
at least 217 people were arrested in the melees police said sorta nuts to me that this many people were arrested in one fucking day back then when only 90 people have been arrested so far for breaching the fucking capitol grounds causing lawmakers to suspend their sworn constitutional duties that day why are any self proclaimed conservatives okay with this shit,1

interesting that like 5x as many people were arrested at that 2016 dc protest as compared to 1 6 21 i say interesting because they invaded the capitol building i know the number of arrests have gone up since last week but day of it was very few also probably relevant to point out that people did not go to dc because hilary claimed for a year that the election was stolen and the rigged and fraud etc and then tell people to go to dc to fight to take their country back etc but certainly you are allowed to criticize viol,1
yes exactly they did not storm the capitol _while the actual votes were being counted_ that is the difference between a protest and a coup,1

first of all its capitol not capital these riots were nowhere near as harmful as what was done at the capitol do not compare them,1
but is not it the case that everyone who signed that petition in 2016 turned out to be right the constitution did need protecting from trump he did make an honest effort to install himself as dictator everything in that petition is spot on,1

there were people kicking up trouble on inauguration day in dc metro police booked like 200ish people that day iirc just no one talking about it edit just read the second article to see that it literally said what i just said im an idiot,1
and its bad on both sides and both deny it it had been a common comment in this sub for quite some time from a quite a few people that opposed to the left we will just go on with our lives without violence this doesn t hold true for any party right now and now the excuse on both sides of the fence is that those inflicting violence are outliers or outcasts within their parti,1
big difference is that those people didn t start because hilary called all true patriots to dc where she riled them up at a rally called stop the steal filled with disinformation to support her claim to have won the election she didn t tell these folks that we have to bring the fight to them or that we needed trial by combat she didn t send them to congress to change congress s mind those rioters didn t march with signs that said hang joe biden for certifying the results of trump s victory they didn t bust into the capitol tearing down american flags they didn t march with the flags of the confederacy or nazi parties they didn t destroy historic property or beat capitol police and while they were not doing that hilary didn t tell them she loved them and call them special let s be actual conservatives here let s work to conserve freedom peaceful transitions and democracy by condemning the actions of the president and his closest support,1
yeah lets compare the 99 99 peaceful 2017 womens march with no deaths to last weeks hang mike pence chants a dead cop 4 dead supporters and an attempt to take senators hostage but antifa burned down a target in protests against police brutality and accountability so this is all the sam,1
yeah the difference is hillary who i do not like didnt start a tirade of unsubstantiated claims and conspiracy theories for months to provoke the rioters also there is a huge difference between a petition and storming the capitol i suppose you think if it was done before then its ok for trump to repeat it now because others done it 4 years ago or 8 years ago or even 100 years ago i do not understand this way of thinking if someone done something bad years ago that really pissed you off would it not be better to not repeat the same mistakes and justify it by saying oh well they done it first i just do not see how everytime something bad happens it turns into the left done this or the right done that it seems no one wants to hear bad things about there party so just look for a reason to blame the other side its really pathet,1

what an odd thing to wonder i must know,1
the idea that a foreign nations would try to influence an election that could benefit them makes total sense there are alot of false narratives and blanket statements going on but if russia sees trump as someone who will lift trade constraints etc then they should try to infiltrate our news social media free news ads etc to try and convince american people that trump is the best option to vote and likewise for china and honestly every country that has a stake in america so each political party should be audited constantly for collaboration before being elected with foreign agents this becomes hard for me personally because if you are already in a seat of politics like senate house governor president i feel like you should be communicating with foreign agents as applicable which causes the grey line to appear for what should be allowed those are my two cents to try to dispel single hate towards anyone to know that it is done on both fronts and how i view it,1

furthermore there was a lot more smoke with the 2016 election than this one multiple people were indicted as part of that investigation and it is pretty clear russia did attempt to swing the election to trump,1
you are going out on quite the limb to make that point the truth is both sides are a bunch of hypocrites and will condone any violence that fits their narrative and gives them power the difference is the left predominately controls what is allowed to be said and actively shuts down opposing voices and destroys peoples lives just for disagreeing or saying something stupid 30 years ago,1
wait are you serious you are already lying two points in she essentially did refuse to concede and then told biden that he should never concede and challenge it the entire way the phone call point you make is completely out of context it s not a great look for him but it s very different from how you describe he lays out his case as to why he believes thousands of votes don t count but then says we don t need to prove them all we only need to get that certain amount there may not be fraud i don t know but you are allowed to make accusations kind of like the left did with russia for 4 years there have been plenty of people killed and hospitalized in riots condoned and pushed by the left in the last year alone you are being extremely disingenuous at the least an outright liar at the worst,1

these riots were nowhere near as harmful i am sure the people who is property and lives were potentially destroyed would disagree with you when you start making exceptions for violence based on the merits of its political goals you have already lost,1
in what way were the blm riots less harmful than the capitol hill protest,1
like politically that i can understand this hurt the republican party a lot although it s severity is mainly propagated by left wing media but nonpolitically the riots throughout the summer and after were so much worse in terms of damage and violence that the two don t even seem comparable with the capitol a bunch of idiots were allowed to just walk in wonder around and mess with stuff with a violent confrontation breaking out in a corridor,1

there s a clear difference between a real conservative and a populist like trump in my mind,1
i recently read i do not remember where something like in a healthy democracy violence is always out of bounds because any reasonable reform can be achieved at the ballot box the blm movement wants police reform specifically that police treat white and black people the same way this is certainly the sort of reform that it is acceptable to seek in a democracy which people did through peaceful means the march for our lives comes to mind but the establishment did not budge even colin kaepernick taking a knee was dismissed as a bridge too far so a lot of people felt rightly or wrongly that they had no choice but to break stuff compare that to what happened at the capitol trump supporters wanted trump to remain in office they got a chance to vote there was a concerted effort to get them registered and help them vote they did not trust the results so they demanded a recount they got a recount sometimes several they raised questions about ballot fraud and irregularities so they filed suit these suits were heard in court with evidence presented from all sides that did not work out they appealed even if not all appeals were heard at least all were taken seriously and then when everything else failed they turned to violence i do not want to condone violence but i find one of these examples a lot easier to justify than the oth,1

you mean all the counties states that did recounts and found almost zero inconsistencies are not enough how about the 15k random ballots checked in georgia by multiple just because someone claims something does not mean it is a fact there needs to be evidence evidence has been searched for and never found thus the statements are not supported by facts the election was clean there was no voter fraud certainly not on the scale that would sway an election in georgia out of 15k ballots they found 2 were truly fraud one was a husband who signed his wifes name thinking that was legal do not remember the other but it was equally innocu,1

yeah it was a popular thing to tease trump on social media for hiding for a day after he made his lackluster tv appearance after the george floyd riots started it wasn t good optics having lived and worked in the area i can tell you that it s common for there to be protesters outside the white house it s an every day occurrence regardless of who the current occupant is has been for at least the past three administrations they don t even pay attention to it it s just part of the regular work day for people to accuse trump of hiding because he wasn t making public appearances at the white house protest is in my opinion ill informed i have no idea why the bunker was deemed necessary i presume the secret service had a reason they didn t bother sharing it with u,1

no they are being accused of treason for pushing the idea that the election was stolen while using instigatroy language designed to get brainless sheep to storm the capitol you do not to explicitly state go storm the capitol to get that idea across to a fomenting crowd looking for trouble anyway and to say they did not know this would be the consequence either makes them a liar or just plain stupid,1

this is what mueller was investigating but again it is such a difficult thing to prove without extremely clear evidence which is why perhaps it is extremely unwise even deranged to shout about this theory on mainstream news channels for days weeks months on end while the investigation is ongoing i would be likewise fine with telling people to shut up about the 2020 election while a special investigator auditor examined it and took in all the available evidence but there is no real call for that for some reason,1

then the gop needs to grow some balls and finally decry what has happened en masse and do something about it even after an attempted coup and prominent gop officials had their lives threatened they are still more worried about losing the trump voters than doing the right thing he is a liability to the party and the country trumps voters are loyal to trump maga movement not the gop and they need to wake up and realize that the gop was a tool trump needed to be elected nothing more if trump does want to run again in 2024 the gop now has to decide if they let him run their party again or if he runs as an independent and guarantees a democratic win as the vote is split remove him from office and impeach to ensure he never runs again inaction shows that this behavior was acceptable and the next time under trump or his successor they might be a lot better organ,1

may i recommend it was all a lie how the republican party became donald trump by stuart stevens it is a brutally honest look at how the republican party has changed over the past oh 40 years or so from a party with ideals and principles to a party that clings to power merely for powers sake this is somewhat in line with the gops post mortem analysis of its 2012 presidential election loss,1
was there more reason to impeach donald trump than say bill clinton yes there was how so last i checked the fbi is investigating the very thing trump wanted investigated that got him impeach,1

it was more than 100 if you watch any of the videos and you are defending an act of domestic terrorism and before you say it is not terrorism here is the definition the unlawful use of violence and intimidation especially against civilians in the pursuit of political aims against the legislative branch of the government egged on by a president who lost the election while that branch was certifying the election results did i like that there was a petition to overturn an election no but that was well within the first amendment rights of the signers to sign it your literally watching a coup and shrugging it off it is disturbing and if left unchecked will be the end of our system of government and your just watching it burn down if you look at history it takes far less than you think to destabilize n,1

if you would checked the link you would notice their source was an economist yougov poll or at the time another from reuters finding similar results basically you guys have this pattern of msm not covering a story because they do not like the results so conservative sources are the only ones covering something and then you dismiss whatever that something is because conservative media its a handy little catch22 you have going where everything you do not like the source is fake news seems familiar,1
hi people i m dad what i am saying is it is intellectually dishonest to compare a leftist riot that was met with proportional force to an actual act of sedition on the congressional campus that put lawmakers in direct danger of being kidnapped or hurt the police stopped me before i was able to grab money from the vault so i didn t technically try to rob the bank well you broke into the bank at night and set fire to the guards office and were at the vault doors when we stopped you what re you re is proposing actual intellectual dishonesty what you literally just said is that appropriate police force prevented them from achieving their go,1

no and no lol protesting near the white house and other federal buildings is 100 legal and a normal thing to do bringing weapons bombs and zip ties while actually breaching a federal building chanting hang mike pence is 100 not legal and not norm,1
you are right that protests outside the white house are basically 24 7 spend enough time in lafayette square and you will recognize some of the regulars but the reason people made fun of trump for hiding is not simply that he would not come out and address the crowd it was because of media reports that he moved or let the secret service move him to the white house bunker for several hours on may 31 2020 and also because he later said he went there for an inspection these were protests that trump did absolutely nothing to calm and indeed exacerbated with his photo op at st johns church,1
was that not the time that trump ended up going to his bunker and then talking about it how he was there only to inspect the bunker not to hide there https news sky com story donald trump says he went to white house bunker to inspect it not because of protests 11999850 not just dealing with the press,1

but we are not discussing that we are discussing the accusations of treason for exercising their rights as elected officials your stance on their intelligence or anyone elses does not really mean anything here many people there peacefully protested are you implying that the small minority of violent people at a largely peaceful protest coordinated with republicans lefties challenged the electoral vote and then ran a sham investigation about russian collusion to further delegitimize trumps presidency no one moved on from the 2016 election and to say otherwise is an outright li,1
they are exercising their rights as elected officials to challenge the election again they are fully within their rights as in they are operating according to us law implying that is treason makes no sense who said go storm the capitol,1

this may be a bit biased but it is the best collective source i can find the georgia issue is not listed but what happened was the state was sued to not throw out or check any signatures where usually 3 on a board are needed to throw a signature out the supreme court could not send the decision back to the states in time because of the purcell rule also the reason any proof of fraud is pointless after a major election 8 states in voting lawsuits with election day less than a week away the heritage foundation https www heritage org election integrity commentary 8 states voting lawsuits election day less week away,1

one difference between then and now is that bandwidth was much more limited and in particular the big three networks competed for everyones views and symmetrically pretty much everyone got the same tv news be they liberal or conservative democrat or republican so there was at least broad agreement on which particular facts were true nowadays there are many more media outlets and so it is possible to build a big company that caters to a niche market fox news being a prime example and from the viewers point of view no pun intended it is much easier to ensconce oneself in a media bubble that shows you only things that confirm your biases for better or worse that genies not going back in the bottle i for one do not want to return to just having three choices for news but i also do not know how return to some semblance of com,1

you think our country should work by murdering police officers and congresspeople when we don t agree with the results from an elect,1
they voted not to hear the case because the president didn t provide any evidence for his claim,1
i m amazed you haven t already done your research,1
i think there has always been fraud but at this point it is just one more variable in the equation that is unless there was irrefutable evidence that there were enough fraudulent votes to drastically change the results i also cannot fathom holding the most powerful office in the land and not have the resources to legitimately prove it in court let us pretend for a second that every single accusation of fraud is true and trump was not able to get any of the many judges he instituted to verify this truthful claims in court that would be a huge sign of incompetence on his part and would not make the situation any bett,1
to start a theory you need evidence the only evidence is that trump said so and had multiple of his claims debunked he s not a reliable source knowing that he started a coup people who want to best for the government don t start coups against them there is simply no evidence in fact the statistics say that there isn t fraud which isn t a hundred percent accurate but it s pretty good you need evidence to start a theory otherwise it s a conspiracy theory conspiracy theories are bullshit random guess,1
what states are you talking about each state has it is own election laws but most states require audits after elections regardless of how close it is those audits work by taking a bunch of paper ballots and match them against the results of the voting machines to look for any discrepancies and if there are any state laws trigger a more thorough accounting of votes chain of custody and signature verification would not be relevant unless that was required by a given states audit process so i do not see why that is relevant this stuff is all very accessible online you can read all about how each state counted certified audited recounted processed ballots etc honestly man i am really starting to feel sorry for yall buying this fraud conspiracy i used to be really angry but it is just sad yall have just gone way off the deep end,1

you ll never have a 100 foolproof system there can be fraud and it can also not be significant enough to swing an election just so i understand your positions you re saying it is more likely wide spread fraud and conspiracy to commit fraud swung the election vs just normal voting you think the democrat only party the states voting regulatory bodies and the county state and federal courts all are in on a conspiracy these same institutions that verified trump just four years ago and many senate and congressional elections since then are now somehow not just broken but actively working together to fix the election given the events at the capitol i wouldn t be surprised if voter fraud did happen it s clear one party cares far less about our laws and institutions american institutions confirmed the election results a guy formally on twitter and a mob don t negate that,1

with all due respect i am not suggesting that russia was trying to help trump only that they attempted to interfer with the election whether they succeeded or not is up for grab and an interesting debate i am not attempting to have that debate only to put the facts forwards when an opportunity arises i have some love for the gop though as a uk conservative i do not line up exactly with american conservatives i have gone into that in some comments here and there when the opportunity has arisen however i very much dislike trump but then i consider him to be a new york liberal with an authoritarian bent using the gop and while doing so having a bloody good go at destroying it i am unsure as to what i am being warned about tbh if it is correcting the record when presented with mis information then please feel free to take away my flair now and that will prevent me from doing it if you look at my comments i do the same whichever sub i am in i got banned from r esist for doing just that i do not argue on the opposite side of issues i know are dear to the hearts of conservativism in the us because i consider this sub to be your house i rarely express what i think about trump too blatantly for the same reason though there are plenty of conservatives who clearly feel the same as me in any event do what you wil,1
well i think coming from an outside country it can be considered election interference especially when the accounts were masked as us citizens and were used to build conversation among right leaning voters to make sure they voted and yet the people starting the conversation were holed up in the ira in moscow i do think there s a problem with what facebook and instagram did as well and if we looked into all posts pushing for left leaning voters to vote i actually think you d find that some of those adverts came from china germany and other nations opposed to a republican victori,1

every single indictment had nothing to do with the election was what you posted furthermore there was a lot more smoke with the 2016 election than this one multiple people were indicted as part of that investigation and it is pretty clear russia did attempt to swing the election to trump was the comment you replied to the comment above that did not mention indictments so how exactly do you draw the conclusion that we are talking about indictments related to alleged trump collusion plus the dept of justice has offered no proof as to why they think these individuals committed crimes heres the 37 page full indictment with a lot of details https www justice gov opa press release file 1035562 download,1
the correct word for that is fascism it s really easy to identify if the folks to the right of you are literally genocidal maybe take that as a hint i don t get american conservatism anymore it s rapidly turning into a personality cult trump is all smoke and mirrors he acts on expedience and not principle same with the modern discourse including this sub it used to stand for something and not just someone and i m just waiting for my ban to be handed out for exactly that reason if you care to read here s a primer https www nybooks com articles 1995 06 22 ur fascism on what exactly that word means it s written by a philosopher who actually lived in italy at the time it very well describes the mindset of the conspiracy theorists and especially those seditionists they re taking over conservatism and ruining a once respectable worldview,1
well then concede that antifa and blm extremists are terrorists too and i didnt see any guns other than law enforcement and there needs to be an investigation into the pipe bombs and molotovs before you call a group terrorists you dont know the facts and zip ties are not weapons bbut you know just buy into the bullshit msm and your cronnies are telling you cause fuck it who needs facts anymore to make a decision apparently not y,1

you know good and well that wasn t racism this is the stuff liberals do you re disgusting he she is probably saying that the blm movement is based on the wrongful deaths of black citizens however only a minority of these were actually unjustified and the rest were clearly non cooperative behavior by individuals who were literal record criminals and few showed signs of stopping this guy made no connection that black criminal in fact that was you insinuating it supporting blm as it is now is supporting misinformation and violence im sorry and dare i say it hurts black people and even if this isn t true it s the fact that you lack the ability to understand your political opponents view point or deliberately try to twist it to get him her banned for racism and to silence him her that is so frustr,1

you re not being high horsed you re being called out for a false equivalence for starters these insurrectionists were engaged in insurrection because their preferred candidate lost an election and were organized and motivated by the leader of the gop and several prominent members one of whom denied the request to bring additional security to the situation this is completely different from protesting the continued lack of consequences for murdering a black person which is not started or motivated by the democratic party nor is it related to overturning the constitutionally mandated transition of power you may be choosing to ignore this but you can hear people engaged in violent breaking talking about finding members of congress and the vp on the many videos and having constructed gallows outside and that you have to go back to the war of 1812 for the last time the capitol was attacked tells us everything we need to know about the validity of your comparisons also while it is indisputable that numerous leos and any is too many were injured in the various george floyd protests across the nation and over the year the claim that 60 were injured in the case you link to is dubious there s a reason all the links when you search for it are fox news it s because there s very little confirmation from official sources for this in the capitol case the cp have released an injury report and at least one was beaten to death again by people rioting in support of a specific political candidate the reason we have elections is so that we don t use bullets but apparently that s the fallback for this crowd in comparison you have cases of the instigators of the blm protests many of which were violently hijacked by extremists protecting the police and the fact that it might have only delayed certification by 24 hours is beside the point had these guys actually captured and done what they were talking about to congress and the vp we d be in a whole different place and i m not even getting into the disparity of the number of arrests between the two which clearly demonstrates the issue the floyd protests were aimed at bringing attention to so in one case we have protests against a real problem that turned violent in the other we have an attempted overthrow of the democratic system that elects the republic s leaders that can only start with plans of violence no matter how aimlessly executed it ended up being there s a big difference ther,1
it will always take months and months for investigations and fraud cases to be decided by the courts for local elections it is not a problem it is not even a problem for a congressional election but the presidential election there simply is not time lawsuits over election issues before the election were thrown out of court because no one had been harmed yet so they did not have standing after the election they were thrown out because too late for relief i can understand the courts not wanting to get involved but they should have thrown the case to the legislature like the supreme court did in 2000 ironically in 2000 it was found in a recount over a year later al gore actually won florida and would have gained enough votes to win if he had complied with florida state law and recounted the entire state demanding only a recount of miami dade cost him the presid,1

that is just a short article about the impeachment with a quote from someone who is trying to paint it as unconstitutionally overturning the 2016 election i want you to tell me what congressmen in 2016 supported overturning the election results because they deemed it fraudul,1

i do not doubt that aoc might have floated that idea i would be interested in seeing some proof of it though even if she did it is still not the same as what is happening here also i do not love any politician and your childish name calling does not make you any more correct it just makes you look like a hateful idiot,1
aoc wasn t elected until 2019 so no lol,1
the impeachment occurred years after the 2016 election and was a result of an investigation that led to dozens of indictments and convictions to people closely affiliated with the trump campaign several of which were high ranking officials the allegations of fraud for this election have been thrown out by every single court with prejudice including a scotus with multiple trump appointed judges that basically unanimously said there was no proof of fraud and yet a ridiculous amount of congressmen still voted to overturn the election but sure they are both the same i guess,1

i do not know what i about my response indicated that i did not read what you wrote i am pretty sure you did not read what i wrote even trump and his cohorts are complicit in asserting unsubstantiated claims about voter fraud knowingly riling the mass,1
comments such as if you don t fight like hell you re not going to have a country anymore when spoken to a crowd looking for a fight are indeed instigatroy context and setting are just as important as the actual words if you cannot see that behind trumps words it is just willful ignorance and we have nothing further to discuss her,1
re read your comment then because you aren t making sens,1
and then the lower courts decided not to hear the case due to lack of evidence across the nation and including the supreme court,1
trump still has media attention he would publish a private instigation on fraud but instead he spreads information that s proven to be wrong if there were fraud he would use real evidence and not perpetuate conspiracy theory he would also stop using hitlers propaganda strategy this includes the i m not leaving office shit the censorship of the other and protesting against antifa and hate of immagrants the nationalism the white supremacy hating journalists he has so much in common with hitler the patriotic education bullshit he s not trustworthy trust needs to be proven,1
hi georgian here can provide some context to that shift the 1 500 shift in the ga margin was due primarily to errors in one county https www ajc com politics election floyd county fires elections chief zqybxsx66jckvb3dfog4hhsbgq essentially floyd county failed to initially count 2 600 votes until the audit discovered them floyd is a rural county and had about 41k total votes so that is a big error relatively speaking the county elections chief for floyd county was fired as a result especially because they also had issues just 6 months earlier during the primaries floyd went 70 for trump so if the omitted ballots were consistent you would expect about 1 800 votes for trump and about 800 for biden a net shift of about 1 000 in trumps favor so you have about 1k shift from just 1 county with 41k votes and the remaining 500 from every other county combined 4 95 million votes in other words other than these omitted votes there was only relatively small margins of error additionally i am not sure about statewide but cobb county at least did an absentee signature audit https www ajc com politics no fraud georgia audit confirms authenticity of absentee ballots qf2ptoghlndlndjewbu56weqhm of 15 000 randomly selected ballots no fraudulent absentee ballots were found 10 had missing or mismatched signatures but after following up with the voters were confirmed legit,1
for example georgia where they found over 1500 votes after doing a hand recount there is only a history of adjustments after recounts no hard margin of error and while 1 5k ballots is on the higher side it is only marginally so recounts have produced 1k adjustments in the past signature verification did not happen in key battleground states with observers as they were forced to be so far away they could not see the actual envelope provide a link please but i will do more research about this every state audits it really does not take research https www ncsl org research elections and campaigns post election audits635926066 aspx,1
however i very much dislike trump but then i consider him to be a new york liberal with an authoritarian bent using the gop and while doing so having a bloody good go at destroying it which is perfectly fine as long as that is not all you are posting about what we do not tolerate is propagating leftist narratives as a part of that dislike your criticisms should be rooted in conservative based arguments not lending support to conspiracy theories on the left posting facts that specifically lend credence to their narrative while lacking context is indeed propagating their narrative trump is a new york democrat and has been his entire life authoritarian is quite the stretch and is another leftist narrative authoritarians do not reduce regulations a direct power of the executive nor do they fail to expand their power as every other president has done when there is a crisis but this is a whole different discussion i am unsure as to what i am being warned about tbh you actively posted links in response to people pushing a leftist narrative with the only intent as to support their claim the link does not support them and all good lies have a grain of truth to them you did not provide any further context on the matter that would clarify their narrative is not supported if it is correcting the record when presented with mis information you were responding to a leftist narrative on russians interfering with the election to benefit a single side you were not responding to a person making a factually incorrect statement and providing a link to correct it,1

because i am discussing what the actual topic is here which is that repubs are being branded traitors for challenging electoral results even though they are fully within their rights to do so dems did the same years ago and were not branded traitors trump called for a peaceful march he did not call for a riot calling the election a sham is not riling the masses telling them to peacefully march is not riling the mass,1

if you are referring to challenging electoral votes then yes they did https www newsweek com donald trump democrats house democrats electoral college election 2016 539801 dems also challenged the election by running with a phony russian collusion story years and millions spent on a conspiracy theory purely aimed at delegitimizing the presidency why were not they branded traitors https www rev com blog transcripts donald trump speech save america rally transcript january 6 i know that everyone here will soon be marching over to the capitol building to peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard i am still waiting on you to source your claim that the riot was coordinated by republican,1

i never said trumpers were not capable of wrong that guy said 2 cops were killed and i was asking how i do not condone murdering people in general i am just trying to expose the hypocrisy of calling this a violent riot and what happened all summer a peaceful protest,1
pretty sure i have not called you a nazi i do not think you are a nazi because you might have differing views from me but you sure do support a lot of the same candidates that nazis and white supremacists also support,1
you need a source for all of trump tweets claiming election fraud and telling people the vote was being stolen have not you seen enough of that yourself i suppose a useful source would be trump organising the rally that then turned into the riot if that is what you want you are intentionally dodging the fact that 5 people were murdered including a cop which was not something that happened with democrats the russian collusion stuff was not the same thing as this besides arguably having evidence which is not relevant to the incoming point the issue with that was voter interference not voter fraud the difference in who ends up being villainised in that assertion is quite significant and no one was encouraged to take back their country you are allowed to challenge the votes just not the way it was done last week you will never take back our country with weakness you have to show strength you have to be strong his words seem to be intentionally walking the tight rope of active encouragement of insurrection this was from his speech preceeding the riot,1
yeah yeah there s that both sides equivocation instead of actual accountability there is absolutely a difference between riots aimed at ending police violence and riots aimed at ending democracy one was fuelled by actual police violence and the other by a president s conspiracy theories they can both be riots but one of the two of them is also sedition state sponsored no less that s definitely worse and needs to be addressed you don t get to claim the high ground by pointing fingers you claim the high ground by actually holding to principl,1
no you stated that the riots were a coordinated effort between republicans and the rioters or at least you heavily implied it you still have not sourced it i am not dodging anything i am just calling out double standards democrats consistently back blm despite the fact that a few years ago a blm sniper murdered several cops blm rallies consistently call for fights against the system and a number of violent riots have spun off of those when do we hold dems accountable for inciting violence you are stretching really hard her,1
what part was sedition protesting inside the capitol,1
and now you are bringing blm into a topic about protests regarding election interference fraud who is the one stretching here bringing that into this makes everything a lot more pointlessly complex i have already said my piece about trumps involvement do with that what you wil,1
i am going to need at least 50 sources on dems backing blm protests please otherwise your point is invalid see how that works both ways quit being obtuse and just accept you are wrong on this on,1
don t try to tell me mike pence would have been safe if the armed mob had gotten to him they built gallows and were yelling to hang mike pence in the rotunda all because trump went and told them falsely that pence could act on his conspiracy theory your defence of this is weak there is no defence for this pointing the finger is not a defence we re all lucky that they didn t kill the elected representatives they were after there would be no coming back from that,1
i am giving situations where political violence occurred including sieging government buildings and democrats did not condemn people in the same way lefties in nyc threw a molotov cocktail at a cop car they are facing charges of murder lefties consistently threw molotovs at cops in nyc the condemnations from the left have been sparse and quiet,1
i did not ask for 50 sources i asked for just one why is that such a bad thing to ask just on,1
do not try to tell me trump would have been safe if the blm mob had gotten to him this summer during the assault on dc and the white house so according to you the blm attacks were also hypothetical sedit,1
comparisons are more accurate if they are about similar circumstances for instance the reason why the protests happened no one is happy about the blm riots and they were widely admonished by all but the vast majority of protests were peaceful and the planning of all of them was intended to be peaceful this riot on the other hand had many people excitedly sharing talk of the violence they wished to commit this event was immediately violent and bloody secondly again these two situations are too distant in terms of what they are actually about people tend to view the protests against systemic racism and the deaths of innocents as just vs this riot as against democracy and based on no substantial evidence fueled by a cult like mentality whether you believe these things are true does not change the fact that this simply is public percept,1
because he does not need to cite anything you presumably have a brain so go do some research on your own and you would find that they are indeed correct you made a claim as well with no citation and now i am asking for 50 sources as that is what it would take for me to believe your claim that dems pushed for blm rioting even when the vast majority condemned the rioting altogether if you only provide one source i would just say it is not good enough that is how it is done around here do not you know,1
hahaha there s a what about for everything isn t there here s what we have on one hand the sitting president of the us was literally telling an armed mob these conspiracy theories to he told them to overthrow democracy and to show strength at the capitol said armed mob raided the white house and killed people to do just that armed radicals broke into the capitol seeking blood elected officials had to evacuate as they were engaged in the democratic process at the foundation of the republic sedition https www dictionary com browse sedition on the other an angry riot seeking justice for members of their community that were murdered by police on video they did not even try to get past security they did not attempt to overthrow the state they were not incited to do it by the president you sure have an answer for everything though the more you do it the more obvious your detachment from reality becomes it s the sort of thing you d expect from the left unprincipled people like you are not conserv,1
blm leaders have endorsed looting members endorse violence a riot is the language of the unheard and this has been going on for years cloaking yourself with social justice does not hide the years of violence looting and discrimination practiced by them the reactions to those instances are largely muted and tossed aside kamala harris even endorsed the riots there have been many blm riots including ones where cops and innocents died but those are swept under the rug antifa excitedly discusses violence they wish to commit upon trump voters on facebook and twitter public perception has been twisted by left media to portray blm as this peaceful organization with good attentions this has been an ongoing effort for years it is no surprise that we consider boarding up businesses a normal thing now but years ago that would have been outrageous you cannot paint with a broad brush and then chide others for doing the sam,1
the burden of proof is on the accuser if you are so confident why do not you just cite a source which claim did i make without sourc,1
i am unprincipled trump never said to overthrow democracy violently so you are just being dishonest here making that connection they blm did not even try to get past security now i am laughing not incited by the president no shit he is the one they would have murdered if they were allowed in but plenty of democrats sure supported their riots unlike trump who immediately disavowed the violence once it became apparent in both cases really it is the hypocrisy that is astounding i am not trying to justify the event or any violence that may have taken place but the spin is unreal especially when compared to their coverage of the blm riots all summer one would think that stormtroopers were gunning guards down with machine guns with the way it is being described in the media when in reality the blm destruction makes what happened at the capitol look like well just another peaceful protest,1
who exactly am i painting a broad brush of please tell me did i not only say the riot was violent since it was that is all 93 of blm protests were peaceful https time com 5886348 report peaceful protests can you source the leaders encouraging violence more importantly i did not even know blm had leaders it is just a hashtag and slogan perhaps the media is twisting things but not the fact that blm is usually peac,1

trump never said to overthrow democracy violently highlights from trump s rally speech https www rev com blog transcripts donald trump speech save america rally transcript january 6 amp all of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical left democrats which is what they re doing and stolen by the fake news media that s what they ve done and what they re doing we will never give up there s never been anything like this we will not let them silence your voices we re not going to let it happen not going to let it happen states want to revote the states got defrauded they were given false information they voted on it now they want to recertify they want it back all vice president pence has to do is send it back to the states to recertify and we become president and you are the happiest people we re going to have to fight much harder and mike pence is going to have to come through for us now it is up to congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy after this we re going to walk down and i ll be there with you we re going to walk down we re going to walk down any one you want but i think right here we re going walk down to the capitol and we re going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women we re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you ll never take back our country with weakness you have to show strength and you have to be strong i spoke to david perdue what a great person and kelly loeffler two great people but it was a setup and i said we have no back line anymore the only back line the only line of demarcation the only line that we have is the veto of the president of the united states so this is now what we re doing a far more important election than it was two days ago we ve amassed overwhelming evidence about a fake election this is the presidential election last night was a little bit better because of the fact that we had a lot of eyes watching one specific state but they cheated like hell anyway pennsylvania has now seen all of this they didn t know because it was so quick they had a vote they voted but now they see all this stuff it s all come to light doesn t happen that fast and they want to re certify their votes they want to re certify but the only way that can happen is if mike pence agrees to send it back so today in addition to challenging the certification of the election i m calling on congress and the state legislatures to quickly pass sweeping election reforms and you better do it before we have no country left today is not the end it s just the beginning so we re going to we re going to walk down pennsylvania avenue i love pennsylvania avenue and we re going to the capitol and we re going to try and give the democrats are hopeless they re never voting for anything not even one vote but we re going to try and give our republicans the weak ones because the strong ones don t need any of our help we re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country so let s walk down pennsylvania avenue i want to thank you all god bless you and god bless america thank you all for being here this is incredible thank you very much thank you the whole thing is just a mess of conspiracies hinging on a false claim that mike pence can and should overturn the election capped off with seditious incitement to march to the capitol and show strength because you ll never take back our country with weakness you have to show strength and you have to be strong fucking yikes that is not a thing a sitting president should be inciting much less anyone that calls themselves conservative i am not trying to justify the event or any violence that may have taken place what the fuck else are your apologetics supposed to be doing you don t get to have a weak opinion on sedition either you re for that shit or against it no amount of finger pointing or equivocations or conspiracy theories will make you right again they broke in literally to overturn democracy they broke in targeting lawmakers they the trumpers did that all because of unproven conspiracy theories advocated by the president and his band of merry men there is no spin on that plugging your ears doesn t make it less tru,1
https nypost com 2020 06 25 blm leader if change doesnt happen we will burn down this system if this country doesn t give us what we want then we will burn down this system and replace it all right and i could be speaking figuratively i could be speaking literally it s a matter of interpretation that is just one instance blm is not a centralized organization but they have people who identify as leaders in interview,1
i see one possible request but considering you said twice now i am curious because i do not think i see the one you are referring to why do not you just repost the quest,1
if you are not even going to respond to my points why bother with a wall of text that still does not support what you are saying the president never told anyone to break into the capitol or be violent that is not what showing strength means again i do not think there was any sedition it was an unruly crowd that was literally allowed into the building by the security guards as can be seen from multiple videos if you are gonna act like a couple broken windows and some cops that got beat up compare to the weeks of destruction that was literally being encouraged by democrat and corporate leaders then you are brainwashed if blm were let into any buildings in dc they would have been torched to the ground as we have witnessed all summ,1
interesting my point about it being mostly 93 peaceful still stands i can assert that most people for blm did not want to riot as evidenced by their actions but i cannot assert the same about the quantity of people who rioted last week i however can still assert that the results and base intentions speak for themselves the entire point of last weeks uproar was to raid the capitol building but that point was not similar with blm for the vast majority of people the people who did riot were admonished by everyone democrats included unfortunately there seem to be a lot of conservatives who approve of their riot https www independent co uk news world americas us election 2020 republicans congress capitol support trump b1783807 html,1
no i just think you are not reading it so i will politely decline until you are done being a troll good day,1
and my point about leaders inciting violence without any serious repercussions or loud opposition from dems also stands most of the people who went to the rally were peaceful many many many of trumps rallies were peaceful and only escalated when lefties showed up to antagonize the entire trump camping was run on law order this is the broad brush painting i am referring to it was intended to be a peaceful protest against certifying election results in a sham election the intention was not to raid the capitol we could talk about how antifa has laid siege to government buildings for months and how that also is not as severely condemned by the same people who are loudly condemning the violence in dc,1
how far away from the topic do you intend to get far enough till you actually make a valid point it seems https m startribune com black lives matter movement must be accountable broaden its vision 326119731 is this loud enough for you how many links do you want me to fetch before you are content that democrats have acknowledged the problems blm has had this is the issue with how you are equating things you decided to compare last weeks riot to the entirety of blm which consists of thousands of protests and now you are trying to not judge the captiol riots as a whole singular event but instead individual parts so you can assign blame accordingly you can get as granular as you want and eventually this entire discussion will become meaningless not to mention it is just another way to veer off topic the ultimate point of all of this is that in the specific context of unrest as a result of elections democrats have not reacted the way republicans have and the republican reaction has been extreme and dangerous to democracy there has been nothing quite this bad in this context if we decide to compare democrat to republican violence besides this context we could broaden what we are talking about forever and ever and it would mean nothing anymore maybe that is actually what you want because it means not admitting what happened was wrong without trying to deflect,1
considering the violence committed up until this point by blm there should be daily calls by lefties to disband the group leaders have used incitedul rhetoric and have openly endorsed violence and looting you really only see right wingers call blm out on its actions with lefties consistently dismissing it with the infamous phrase mostly peaceful protest lefties cannot claim to want to unify while also looking away when blm or antifa act up i am merely using the same rhetoric lefties have used for years to describe lefty violence which is that the protest was mostly peaceful with a minority group of bad actors which is true in this case the difference is that almost all conservatives have openly and vigorously condemned what happened at the capitol the same cannot be said for the reactions or lack thereof of dem politicians over the past few years i mean at one point antifa had actually taken over a city block in seattle with weapons and were going door to door to charge protection fees the mayor who is a dem called it all part of a summer of love now do you understand,1
ok let us get this out of the way firstly you are not directly acknowledging anything i am saying 93 of blm protests have been peaceful according to the source i provided do you acknowledge thi,1

he is not wrong qists are a blight on the movement they have wrapped their entire identities around a secret and nefarious being who feeds them a daily dose of bullshit without an iota of proof even qs first drop was fiction the phraseology the lexicon all of it has been adopted by these poor dopes and it just tarnishes the entirety of what it means to be a conservative there is no q there never was the sooner people understand that the better of they will be but oh no if you even say it you are a shill for whom who fucking knows it is just an easy dismissal for them to spout,1
i know some q people sadly they honestly believed jan 6 was the storm or whatever trump would never denounce q because he was the hero in that conspiracy if trump had won they would have been very empowered and more vocal these people need to wake up asap,1
i wish trump denounced qtard shit when it start,1
i do not know much about them but from everything i hear they are just but job conspiracy people with republican flavor we do not need that crazi,1
i know a dude who got pretty heavily into the q stuff he was saying all this crazy shit like trump losing was all planned just wait and acting like pence was going to be arrested for treason it s batshit crazy the really sad thing is that he seems to have finally woken up to the fact that biden is our president rather than question the crap that he s been fed for months he is doubling down and saying that there is more corruption than they believ,1
my mother in law is in deep sharing stuff with the family the latest is that trump will still be president he never said biden in his concession speech and the next admin will be him and someone other than pence also don t forget that all credit cards will stop working and the internet too so go buy food and supplies because it ll get bad can t make this stuff up,1

the trumpian wing of the party needs to be expelled asap a potato sack with an r on it could have beaten hillary would probably have beaten biden and absolutely would have had more republican senators elected in 2020 more importantly the disingenuous fealty to trump and obvious compromise of personal integrity in the process needs to be disassociated with the party i used to hope for cruz as president in 2024 but now he must go the longer the party takes to understand and act on this the more damage to our nation the democrats will be able to achiev,1

i mean i don t disagree with him the q anon people are crazy but i don t know anybody who actually a scribes to that obviously there are cute on people but i don t know where or who they are because i ve never met a conservative who actually is into the q anon stuff,1
rubio is right in this instance but just to be clear we need to be careful with this guy he has about a mitt romney chance of winning in any general elect,1
i m a conservative my family is mostly conservative i have plenty of conservative friends although way more liberal friends with that said i know of one person who knows one person who keeps up with q no one in my circle just one person two degrees of separation away yet every single one of my liberal friends swears that we re all obsessed with q,1
i still don t even know what qnon i,1
i do not even know what q is lol,1
i am sure the majority of regular every day conservatives already think these small extreme groups are morons the things people are pissed off at are liberals double standards the lefts take over of social media as a tool of propaganda they can demonize conservatives at a constant and falsely make us out as monster via twisting things in the news cherry picking completing making things up or taking things out of context then they will not report anything bad the left does and cover for them there is a different set of rules regarding how a liberal vs conservative will be treated by social media and the news now they are openly removing conservative platforms while keeping liberal ones that call for violence and hate daily liberals can do horrible things with no consequences if conservatives even slightly break the rules the hammer comes down hard you can see how bad things are if you just google gab or parler they on wiki come up listed as a place for the far right to gather nazis white supremacists and things like that when if you actually participate in those social platforms you know even if that stuff is there they are not making up the majority and no one likes them most people there are regular conservatives yet those on the extreme left can spit out racism daily against those whom are white they can call for violence to those they do not like they can praise the death of conservatives they can praise the riots that occurred on their side and all kinds of horrible and vile things there are serious problems right now and things are not going to get bett,1
he is right but he is a bit of a tard too but hey do not confuse imperfect friends with mortal enemies and all that,1

while i do agree q is a psyop marco has no room to speak he is irrelevant and loves his soap suds parties if you know what i mean,1
republicans need to stop indulging qtards and other wackos maybe marco should say that to democrats first where the wackiest and most dangerous factions of our society are harbored and systematically protected it infuriates me that we have republicans who have no awareness about what their opposing party i,1

i don t trust this guy he seems like a flip flopper and says whatever will get him in the new,1
rubio was my first choice back in the republican primaries in 2016 i have always been a fan 2024 he could be the diplomatic more moderate voice that the gop needs to move forward post trump,1
every group has wacko tag along,1
i m sorry for being uninformed but what is a qtard what is q,1
come on now do republicans really indulge q anon people i mean really i wouldn t advocate it if they did but i also don t really see it especially when you compare it to the blatant and unwavering support that democrats offer the extremists on their side republicans at worst tolerate extreme points of view the democrats support and encourage them,1
i don t trust anyone with ears that look like that,1
i have never known a republican to indulge q followers at least not on the basis of being q followers everyones got a hobbi,1
i mean yea althought i dont think q is mainstream so im not sure they are indulged necessarili,1
they should but democrats still protect their own tards even promote them and receive absolutely zero flack for it,1
how many sips of water did he need to get that sentence out,1
delet,1
so tbh i havnt researched a lot of q anon stuff yet why are they so crazi,1
rubio isn t going to make a lot of friends as a republican using democrat talking points whoever advises him on politics is doing a very poor job,1
i have never heard conservatives talking about this q stuff ever it is almost exclusively a left wing talking point,1
i am not a fan of the q stuff but rubio is far worse in my opinion he backstabbed the president for year,1

nobody in trumps base indulges the wackos only people who believe in the conspiracy do in my experience the mainstream take i have heard is that it is a controlled opposition designed to distract supporters from focusing their energy on real issues that matter and it doubles as a scapegoat for the left to point at,1
i hate this it validates exactly what the left is trying to do comments like this suggest that republicans or any other party are somehow responsible for the actions of every group that supports them irrespective of what they stand for repubulicans need to stand up for a basic set of principles and a philosophy of government if that indulges fringe elements that is irrelevant what is sad is that key leadership from across the democratic party spent all summer publicly indulging condoning and encouraging the violent rioting that took place across the country yet not one raised a concern about how they might be indulging wackos we need to stop letting the left define the narr,1

they have been saying the storm was imminent for the last 3 years a friend of mine is into q and back in 2017 she put red next to october on her calendar on her fridge because something huge was supposed to happen to this day she simultaneously admits q has gotten some things wrong while saying every prediction he has made has come true 100 her excuse is that sometimes he intentionally throws misinformation out there to throw off the deep state her reasoning is just a mass of contradictions there is no standard of evidence she cannot even say what qs predictions mean until after they have come true the sad thing is her and i both grew up together as jehovahs witnesses who use the same mental tricks as the q movement believe me q is not new q is just a run of the mill doomsday cult with a new wrapping it takes advantage of two things first the desire for insignificant people to feel more important than they actually are and second the inability to face the fact that the world is just chaos and there is no secret cabal or invisible hand guiding the whole thing to some end,1
you d think they d get exhaust,1
trump would never denounce q because he was the hero in that conspiracy maybe thats why we need leaders who have actual morals beyond me good,1
delet,1
trump would never denounce q he did not even know who they were he never heard of them before when he asked who they were and they explained they were fighting pedophilia he just said well it is good they are fighting pedophilia,1
i have a few people i know who have been down the rabbit hole with all that i humor them just because it seems interesting to me if anything they say were to actually happen i always have to think to myself what if what if all this time something actually is going on behind the scenes and the swamp is so deep that it would take the deep conspiracy wakos to be correct one time for things to happen down vote if you want but i do all my own research on anything i hear and i ll at least listen to craziest of theory ,1
denounce a group that sees him as some sort of literal savior there is no way his ego would allow that,1
he s the hero of their world he would never denounce it,1
are you kidding trump is a narcissist and this is literally a cult that he is the central figure of trump is not going to turn down worshippers no matter how crazy they ar,1
it s probably an ego thing or trump doesn t care enough to do anything about it,1
same,1
even if he did you think they would car,1

iirc they asked him to denounce it at a debate townhall and he did not even know what it wa,1
that would be part of the plan though literally nothing can convince them they are being misled because they find some amazing new way to justify it when the stuff doesn t happen,1
isnt that cancel culture though,1
he did not know much about it also if they want to believe something that is their right that is how republicans fall for the same media clap trap over and over and they lose the media win,1
yeah i have checked out several q threads before to see what it is that these idiots talk about and it is incredible they will take the most trivial inane comments made by politicians and try to decipher it in ways that are honestly hilarious i would post an example but i am worried i would just get banned for it,1
if a qanoner makes it into heaven and god himself told him that q is not real the qanoner would just say the conspiracy goes higher than i thought jokes aside q is replacing jesus himself in the eyes of some of these people i have read articles where pastors are concerned about losing their congregations to q i honestly think we are watching a new non abrahamic religion form before our very ey,1

trump got people because he was the only politician talking about the things that actually mattered to them in decades most people if you got them in a room by themselves do not really give that much of a fuck whether other people have abortions or whether we have this foreign policy or that foreign policy most people want a good stable job that keeps a roof over their head food on the table and allows them to save up enough to have fun every once in a while anything beyond that most people really do not care all that much trump hit them on the issues that affect what they care about he straight up told them i am going to fight so you can have a good job feed your family and have some fun sometimes did he deliver on that maybe a lot of plants he visited claiming he was going to save all their jobs carrier in indiana for one ended up outsourcing and moving out of country anyway but i am sure someone could bring up some new plant that opened somewhere else and created jobs so i do not really know point is he talked about what people cared about the gop long ago rolled over on globalization trade agreements etc nafta was bipartisan ross perot was the only presidential candidate against it in 92 i grew up in rural michigan i saw first hand what nafta did to our small towns i am old enough to remember booming small businesses on main street the electrolux plant in greenville michigan employed 3 000 people in a town of less than 10 000 they left town and shuttered their doors for juarez mexico putting nearly 1 3rd of the towns population out of work all at once you know what jobs came in place wal mart came in a few years later and hired about 500 that is it half of downtown closed want to know why people are demanding a 15 hour minimum wage because mcdonalds and wal mart are the only places left to work they cannot just go and get a factory job and make more it is either be poor or pay tens of thousands of dollars for a college education and still probably end up being poor but in debt to boot our system is set up to where you are limited in your potential unless you are a doctor lawyer or engineer that or if you start your own business which typically carries heavy risks of its own and requires shit tons of startup capital and not one presidential candidate democrat or republican spoke out against it not until trump came along we have long memories in the rust belt and we never fully got over it trump is basically the bernie sanders of the right criticize sanders all you want but he was the only democrat talking about the skyrocketing costs of health care housing and education you may not agree with his solutions but he was the only one acknowledging them as problems in the first place i hope the gop learns the lesson that you can have a candidate who cares about all the things trump said he cares about without being a narcissistic psychopath trump should not be the best you have to tackle these issues and if trump had just behaved himself better he could have set the gop up on this path and made them a force to be reckoned with instead he is dividing the party on the way out and setting up the democratic party to have complete control for a generation and he does not care he really does not care which party has power as long as it is him he sees the gop as betraying him and he wants to take them down regardless of the long term consequences because trump does not think long term trump only thinks in terms of what will make me feel good right now,1

i am not a chris christie fan and i do not care what your ideology is but that was funny as fuck rubio just sat there and kept being a robot spewing the same prepared speech proving christies point over and over again it is like he literally short circuited up on stag,1
let us dispel with this fiction that marco rubio does not know what he is doing he knows exactly what he is do,1
i ve only met one and it was clear once you started talking to them that they bought into really weird conspiraci,1
unfortunately many in my family are q anon people it is very frustrating trying to talk with them as you can imagin,1
same here the left just wanted to use it to paint all conservatives in that light it is very dishonest and blown out of proportion the debate with guthrie she actually brought up q and made a big deal out of it which is just absurd i do not even think trump hardly knows what it is based on everything i have ever heard him say about it based on what i have heard q seems pretty insane but why give them attention that just makes it worse and the media knows that which is why they bring it up,1
he s moderate pretty likeable but has this weird thing of being stuck on one topic for long and christie abused him for it still though he might ve learned from his mistakes and improv,1
yet every single one of my liberal friends swears that we re all obsessed with q it is easy to hate a group when you make them all out to be crazy whackos we would do well to remember a lot of biden voters are humans too not all of them are crazy left wing nutjob,1
i do not know one either but people did elect marjorie taylor green,1
my experience as well my experience with q is like the trump vs savanah guthrie clip where they think they re on the correct side and they re saying insane shit and you re like what tbe hell is this person on i still can t find q stuff on any normal webpage anyway maybe it s in the dark web,1
i m in the same boat i don t know where q comes from is it a 4chan thing or just a youtube channel but even the biggest conspiracy theorists in my group never talk about it the first time i heard about it was on reply all podcast,1
for some reason liberals get mad when you say this it s bizarre they started using the term and then expect everyone to know what it i,1
same here i have tried to learn just to satisfy my curiosity but a lot of the info is banned from the internet the tidbits i have heard about sacrifices in pizza shops aliens sound pretty delusional it makes me wonder how any sane person could be lured into this edit to the person who tried to give me a basic explanation of q please dm me i cannot read more than the first sentence of your post if you are not flar,1

the proud boys allow members of other races in but they are certainly tolerant and open to white supremacist beliefs they are not white supremacist in the sense of what you are born as but more white supremacist in a cultural sense they well most of them do not care what color your skin is but to be a member you must conform to white values aka the western european value system and lifestyle it is not strictly racism as much as it is culturalism conform to basically 1950s values or else they accept non white people who dress speak and act white but not those who do not show me a proud boy who celebrates kwanzaa and i will admit i am wrong but somehow i doubt they are very supportive of the more ethnic behaviors and values the racism is not in my skin color is better than yours but more the culture people with my skin color created is inherently superior to the culture people with your skin color created perfect historical example cecil rhodes he did not think black south africans were inherently inferior to white people but he felt their culture was he despised tribal people being happy without having many possessions he felt the western ideal of working yourself to death so you can surround yourself with material wealth was inherently superior it is no different than the us destroying the native american tribal way of life because they felt it was savage but any study into the hunter gatherer lifestyle proves it actually results in far less stress and greater satisfaction with life as well as better health there is a trade off though because now that everybody is spending all their time working for their survival needs there is no time to create or build anything beyond those needs but ask anybody who is successfully lived the off grid homestead lifestyle the rat race is inherently worse for your overall well being but most of us are just unable to escape it so we convince ourselves it is superior essentially it is the belief that life should not be that easi,1
it comes in waves i remember back in the bush era people were saying that about the republicans the democrats were the messy disjointed party while the republicans followed the leadership in lock step it was not all that long ago when opposing the iraq war got you ostracized as a pinko commie terrorist sympathizer who should be on a watch list i specifically remember when nancy pelosi first became speaker of the house her stated goal was the make the democrats like the republicans in that regard personally i do not like either party being like this but you pretty much have to be a united front if you want to get anything done in washington whether you like it or not,1

he sure did not use peaceful language maybe he did not actually intend that to happen knowing how a narcissists brain works i doubt it just seeing how he conducts himself for the past 4 years i believe he loved it and the speech condemning it afterwards was a deal he made with pence not to 25th him right then and there he put his vp and his familys life in danger for doing nothing but fulfilling his constitutional duty have a problem with the election results then maybe trumps team should have actually claimed fraud in their lawsuits they were claiming fraud in the months leading up to the election and were challenging the results in court for months after they lost 60 cases many to judges trump himself appointed because guiliani is a fucking embarrassment of a lawyer and sure maybe you can claim widespread government conspiracy even among all the justices trump appointed but even granting that you have to then admit that if trump really is trying to fight the deep state he is really really really fucking bad at it how is appointing dozens of deep state judges spending four years campaigning for deep state republican congress members and senators and appointing three deep state supreme court justices who have lifetime appointments that he nor any other president can remove supposed to be fighting this supposed deep state i am calling a spade a spade here trump is a simple minded narcissist who only thinks in terms of what makes him feel good in the short term it is the only way i can make sense of the last four years i have dealt with these people all my life maybe i am wrong but i doubt it trump has a history of using language irresponsibly and then washing his hands of what some of his extremist followers do afterwards there were people who showed up with zip ties people who intended to do harm from the very start they came there expecting a revolution and while trump may not have explicitly told them go storm the capitol and execute congress he certainly was not de escalating or calling for calm on that stage either trump came out later to condemn it but at that point it is like a drunk driver saying maybe i should not have tried to drive after crashing the car i know an instigator when i see one and trump is on,1

this isn t strictly about polling numbers it s about integrity and distancing the party from violent radicals including trump and those who continue to support his efforts to stay in office even if he had been elected the actions he took directly inciting an attack on another branch of the federal government and his own vice president are more than enough to rightly impeach and remove him from offic,1

we would do well to remember a lot of biden voters are humans too not all of them are crazy left wing nutjobs thank you for saying this reddit would often make us think otherwise because the crazy nut jobs seem to gather here i have many friends and family who voted for biden they are kind hearted empathetic even religious people who are in church every week of course i do have a few left wing family members who spew nothing but hate and death threats for conservatives but they truly are the minority and even their fellow liberals see them as crazi,1
from what i have heard it was started by some guy named q on 4chan who made random bs drops like he said hillary obama and the deepstate would be arrested it eventually devolved into several different conspiracy theory sub groups that start from that same basic premise that donald trump would throw these people in prison for doing stuff that is different between each little crazy qanoner group,1
that is an example of the conspiracy having it is roots in fact i do not think anybody can realistically deny that there are a lot of pedophiles in positions of power pedophiles are everywhere and the ones who are not in a position of power are the only ones who typically get punished for it there may even be one or two rings going on among saudi princes or russian businessmen or what have you they use that to trap you and slowly over time introduce you to the jfk jr faked his death and he will join president trump in putting an end to it once and for all crazi,1

i have some sda in laws sda is definitely more mainstream than jws they are a more direct line to millerites than jws are but the founder of jws got a lot of his ideas from millerite preachers and only broke off to found his own religion because he did not accept hellfire the trinity or the immortality of the soul,1
unlike hermaphroditic frogs there s absolutely no truth in phytoestrogens behaving in an estrogenic manner i have no idea why this lie blew up so much,1
human beings are not frogs for one frogs do not really have any differences in their plumbing male frogs do not have a penis and female frogs do not have a vagina they both just have a cloaca which is basically just one big all purpose hole for everything and the only difference is one makes eggs and shoots them out of the cloaca while the other shoots sperm out of the cloaca so it would not take much hormonal changes to change how an amphibian works it is actually a decent survival adaptation if you suddenly found yourself in a population with way more males than females then a bunch of those males could become female for the purpose of reproduction or vice versa i mean if alex jones is that freaked out over frogs changing sex do not tell him anything about earthworms who are all hermaphroditic naturally then,1

because of memes prob,1
yes i m sure he knows about biology but they re changing that definition for men and women now you see but his worry was that men were being feminized like i joked above which was received poorly hehe he believed it was through the food or water that s causing men to not be as masculine anymore i agree there s a culture shift to cause it but i m not sure it s also caused by food or water as an environmental factor,1
and you did the media punches up the saturation to exaggerate the bronzer stuff he wear,1
it becomes a problem when people take said memes as fact i will gladly enjoy tofu and soy milk along with meat thank y,1
i will believe that if there is compelling proof but how do you measure masculinity and yes there is toxic masculinity toxic masculinity is coming home drunk and beating your wife and kids it is verbally abusing and physically abusing your children to the point where they can barely function as adults the problem is when people rightly point out that we need to fix these extremes other people want to take it too far and say things like not wanting to have sex with a transgender person is a hate crime or acknowledging that transwomen have inherent physical advantages to ciswomen that should disqualify them from competing in certain sports where that physical advantage is relevant is bigotry every issue is just rubber banded too far and then the backlash snaps it back too far into the regression territory nobody can just say hey alcoholism and domestic violence are wrong and leave it at that,1
yes some memes have a bit of truth to them which makes them funny but sometimes they re just jokes i actually like almond or oat milk better sometimes tofu is pretty good,1
toxic masculinity is not masculin,1
i think jones issue was men today are physically weaker and just not interested in getting exercise i haven t seen his podcast about the frogs but he uses to be a body builder so i wonder if part of his concerns are from that too,1
mapo tofu is the shit i am no vegan but i like traditional soy foods as part of my diet,1
there are fewer reasons for men to be in shape back in the day most jobs were physical you were on a farm or you worked in a factory you were on your feet lifting things all day nowadays more and more occupations are sitting in front of a computer it is no longer a matter of survival or comfort to be in shape i tell you what if i worked a physical job i would be highly motivated to stay in better shape because it would make my daily life that much easier you do not see fat guys in construction very often for a reason i think a better explanation than chemicals in our drinking water is the fact that we have more reasons not to exercise today than in the past it was easy to be in shape 100 years ago because there were no tvs computers or phones to park your ass in front of back then being fat meant you were rich and you were actually considered more attractive for it throughout history being a little thick was considered the ideal beauty standard hell even today you go to a country like cambodia and the women there will fawn all over you if you are a fat white guy in places like that it is an indication of wealth and stability being poor and fat is a very recent development in human histori,1
i ll have to check it out,1
we might have it easier now so we don t need to be physically fit but that doesn t mean it s ok exercise has shown to improve mental health for example i m part of a group that encourages exercise to beat depression exercise out of depression yes there are some chemical components there too but physical health is important for mental health it s not good for someone to be cooped up inside all day i would also say it s more expensive to be fat because of all the calories one has to consume to stay at that weight which i guess would make one poor if all they do is spend money on food,1
this is where i would start if you want to make it at home https thewoksoflife com ma po tofu real d,1
i am just providing a plausible explanation for why things are the way they are not an endorsement of it i would also say it s more expensive to be fat because of all the calories one has to consume to stay at that weight which i guess would make one poor if all they do is spend money on food not necessarily we have a very unusual situation in which calorie rich foods are extremely cheap not to mention everybodys metabolism is different and is somewhat malleable eating a 1500 cal day diet will cause some people to lose weight and other people to gain that is why exercise is an inextricable part of the picture it is calories in calories out but you have control over your calories out every bit as much as you have control over your calories in,1
thanks sounds like it s pretty spici,1
they may be calorie dense but they re rather empty and eating out and eat fast food all the time is expensive because those foods aren t protein rich so you eat more to feel full and really liquid calories people don t seem to count and sugar is addictive processed foods aren t the best it s cheaper to make your own food and buy canned food or produce i agree with cico for sure edit ah i see you were just making a case for another side of it,1

because we elected their puppet,1
how can america the beacon of freedom just became the small brother of the ccp commie regime my friend they have been doing it for decades remember how it slowly became accepted that speech violence that if someone said something offensive it was not only right but righteous to ostracize them make them lose their job destroy their life and assault them ever noticed the prevalence of r justiceserved threads where a 14 year old says the n word and they get put into a coma as a result this is where that leads if speech violence then all the tools to stop violence are legitimate to stop it trump being censored is just the start biden has already announced he intends to pass a law on domestic terrorism that is guaranteed to focus on speech they dislik,1
it is now the beacon of ccp in the west soon real journalists tv hosts will be going to jail along with youtubers who disagrees with the demoncrat,1

exactly you can hate trump and still see that this is a horrifying preced,1
she is never really hid the fact that she dislikes trump more or less just tolerated him whenever they met lol,1
the majority of germans dislike trump including the chancellor merkel thinks that trumps claims of fraud are bullshit and that he should accept bidens win she is also very critical of what has happened at the capitol and thinks that it is partially trumps fault however merkel in this case agreed that the banning of trump should not have happened she does not simply agree with everything that goes against her political opponents and in this case she agrees with them because she genuinely thinks that private companies should not have such pow,1
dislike is relative pres t came in and asked in his way the eu to pay up or shut up when you are used to getting things at a discount and new leadership comes in saying the discount is over you would be a bit peeved too in addition it costs us a ton to sustain military presence there while germany makes a ton making and exporting military equipment without sustaining a strong military themselves it all aligned with pres t holding our allies more accountable and having some equity especially with those allies that have fairly strong economies what they did not like was pres t coming in and instead of rolling over and playing according to their rules as has been done previously he wanted change and was willing to pack his stuff and leave that is just a classic bafo approach to negotiation other countries are not used to that kind of tactic from the us of course taking a sterner position with our allies was characterized by the mainstream as pres t pissing on them,1
trump did try to weaken the current leaders of eu and support the dissenting voices in european union against german and french dominant position in it so yeah one could say merkel has no reason to like trump especially since it is likely that a democrat in the white house would likely be better for their interest,1

this is the amusing and horrifying part anitfa out marketed the president and salesman of coined phrases by simple repetition routinely call the opposition fascists until neutrals become your supporters and suppress anyone that does not convert the average joe at your job at the super market or wherever whether nefarious or not repeats that shit because it is what is been peddled to them ignorance is not bliss here it festers and is taken advantage of with the objective of conversion or be silenced die as a chicagoan i am so outnumbered it quickly goes from enraging to numbing there is no critical thinking anymore and those that wish to often silence themselves to avoid conflict personally i can only discuss debate and argue the same opposing talking points for so long before i silence myself too out of fatigue yet another victory for repetition i guess,1

it sounds like they are for regulating these companies regulation is complex but i want to make sure conservatives think this out very clearly the reason that everyone is having trouble with this one and being accused of cognitive dissonance is pretty simple actually they are unable or not willing to connect the dots that these companies are clearcut monopolies as a monopoly any censorship is defacto anti competitive and you do not even need to necessarily invoke free speech values that said i do think there is a very clear and consistent argument for the government regulating a monopolistic private takeover of what was once considered the public square a cartel that exerts monopoly control of the digital public square can and should be treated differently than businesses that are merely interacting with it when you frame it this way there is little similarity between facebook twitter and a bakery shop muh private company is not the argument that some on the right left thinks it is now the one million dollar question is are these tech verticals best served by a monopoly if so then we need to regulate if not then we need to break them up this is precisely why protecting and promoting competition above all else is the key to a true free market,1

not wrong i mean the eu has been a bit sketch on free speech in the last few years its amazing what global politics can teach us about our own country right now edit did more research into angela merkel she is not as left leaning as i once thought thats a my bad i had a better understanding of german politics back in 2015 when the syrian refugee stuff was happening and her policies were made out to be left leaning which even on that they are not but its still embarrassing that the eu is calling us out for allowing censorship when we have a document that is the backbone of our law and government saying censorship is not to happen the only debate to be had is can a private organization like twitter remove people based on political policy if someone has evidence that trump incited violence it would clear up a lot but untill then this is blatant censorship,1

yes this 100 this is a good comment and i like it a lot not everyone here understands what trump represents yet,1
for some context everybody who is allowed to vote here in germany has the option to request their mail in ballots online as soon as you do that a notification will be added to the electoral dictionary so you do not get your vote counted twice 4 weeks prior to the election the papers will be sent to the homes via deutsche post you can still request them after that as well does not have to be at least four weeks before the election this is just the time when they start to send them every citizen also automatically receives an authorization paper which you need for in person voting with the combination of your id card does not matter if you requested the mail in ballots mail in voting is a lot safer here so i do not see a problem with people using it although i do not person,1

mail in voting is a lot safer here so i do not see a problem with people using it although i do not personally the question is during corona times is it still mailed by request only or mass mailed to all without a request in usa the latter happen,1
keep in mind americans are not aware of the full extent of their treason yet when they fully start to grasp what is happening we need to remember to be good stewards of our country and put petty vindictiveness aside our countrymen will just be waking up and america needs to be put first there is going to be people whose entire reality is going to come crumbling down and they are not going to handle it well this what unity and healing will mean,1

quotes from around the sub that are super relevant in this topic for sure free speech isn t or shouldn t be an us versus them thing the principle of free speech is for everyone their stance is on the side of free speech not ours since it exists outside of our flavor of politics this is direct cause of identity politics when you define the world between good and bad when you define yourself and all of your comrades as good then when you have power you cannot do no wrong if you sometimes see some of your fellows doing something that you do not understand it just means that you are not good enough follower and have to work more to match their level of goodness the unfortunate thing is that people who engage to this kind of thinking rarely fully wake up because they tie their identity so strongly to the cause good luck competing against amazon microsoft and google for server space also amazon s servers account for more than half of the internet s hosting companies are free to choose what they do but when you become bigger than the government in power and influence what does it mean now they already started doing it to firearm companies cutting off their banking services operation chokepoint also banks have been targeting individual companies closing their accounts and credit lines paypal refuses to do business with firearm companies boa has dropped firearm and firearm accessory manufacturers the next logical step is to start doing this to conservatives i ve seen many people advocating ostracizing conservatives from commerce in the last several days calling for people to fire conservatives refuse to do business with them etc and they get tons of upvotes pretty scary sentiment cryptocurrencies are a viable alternative to traditional banking but the problem is that the irs decided that cryptocurrencies are capital assets not currencies so every time you exchange bitcoin for a good or service you have to record the fair market value of the bitcoin you traded and calculate your net loss or gain since you purchased that bitcoin which means that anyone forced into dealing exclusively in bitcoin for payment is going to have an accounting nightmare this is the scariest thing that has happened in the past week aws which hosts almost 50 of all internet websites now has the public ok to just turn off whatever they do not want people to see on the internet ironically amazon hides behind section 230 protections to so they are only liable to pull down content that is illegal once it has been reported and verified but parler doing the same instead of using proprietary ai bot networks to conduct preemptive user surveillance and mine user data for use by the tech cartel that is grounds for amazon to kick them off what garbage tier human beings these are this is obvious anti competitive practice and collusion between apple google amazon facebook and twitter it is illegal and should be punished to the furthest extent of the law under the sherman anti trust act corporatism is the bane of capitalism and must not be tolerated google and amazon control major dnses if they wanted to they could block replication and effectively silence it for anyone using their services google is going to start blocking websites in chrome in the next few years guarantee it apple will block websites in safari as well pretty soon just accessing a normal website is going to be like to accessing a tor darkweb site you will need to use a special web browser to do it even if they did that they still need the public ip addresses and dns registration to operate both in witch are controlled by icann in witch apple google amazon and the government can pressure icann to revoke the ip address and dns names effectively killing parler hey re focusing on content and app providers now but i bet that the next shoe to drop is that they will start to control users it will be something like you void your warranty if you have apps or if you access content that isn t approved by them because security risks potentially compromise your hardware or some bullshit like that not only will you void your warranty but you won t have access to the app store at all maybe they blacklist you and won t even sell you a phone if you don t comply with their values you don t get to participate in modern technology twitter stock drops after they ban trump and suddenly multiple megacorps simultaneously shut down their biggest competition collusion is illegal contact law relies that the terms be clear and objectively verifiable parler afaik relies on us jurisdicational law to implement its moderation policy hence this is a clear and objective standard so for aws to say it is breach of their t c then they would need to show there is a failure on parlers part to meet those standards if not then what is left is aws one sided and subjective interpretation of the contract and this is so one sided in terms of each parties power then they voided the contract and so may be subject to damages to the business losses parler suffered amazons failure to give parler a commercially reasonable period to cure is also somewhat suspect given they canceled them over a weekend with very little notice amazon can take the hit they are extremely diverse i would not gamble against them at least not betting for much more than a couple point drop facebook and twitter are much more directly tied to just income streams from users with twitter being more vulnerable imo do note that the effects of users ditching them could take a quarter or two to be realized on their balance sheets i d expect them to drop a little bit more this coming week then rally back up for a while if any serious drop comes it will likely be after or shortly before if

the trump camp has had months to investigate election irregularities they have been laughed out of court including scotus literally dozens of times trump is going to claim he won the election no matter what the evidence says that is clear every time he loses he claims fraud he accused ted cruz of fraud when he lost the iowa caucus neither trump nor his most extreme supporters will ever accept anything other than the conclusion he won the election no amount of investigation will ever be good enough even if they got their 10 days and examined everything fairly and openly and the conclusion still came back that biden won the presidency trump would not accept it at this point i have very little reason to believe a 10 day investigation would bring about anything ground breaking beyond what is been brought up in the past few months the idea that millions of votes were fraudulently cast is a very serious accusation and the trump administration again has had months to present this evidence not only have they not presented any evidence affadavits are not evidence they have not even claimed voter fraud in their court cases beyond a few hundred votes here or there sidney powell even rebuffed tucker carlsons request for this evidence trumps own ag said there is no evidence of fraud to the level that would overturn the election these are not all just liberal justices saying this either many of these are judges trump himself appointed including three of the scotus judges that rejected the pennsylvania case at this point there are only two possibilities either there is a vast conspiracy against trump at all levels of government and trump is really really really really bad at fighting it considering almost everybody he is ever hired or appointed is supposedly in on it or trump lost and his ego is too big to ever admit it if i am applying occams razor here i am leaning toward the second option even if i am wrong the fact that trump has entrenched agents of the deep state even more into the highest levels of government out of sheer ineptitude is a black mark on his record at this point you have to ask yourself is there any situation in which trump would admit defeat if not it is really hard to see any requests for delays and continuances especially since it would be unconstitutional at this point as being made in any sort of good faith it is clear there is only one conclusion the trump administration will ever accept and when only one conclusion is acceptable no requests for investigation are made in good faith,1

hey guys pretty cool to see a non flair required post around here pretty smart to do it for this particular content just wanted to ask is this really what we want i think corporate control run amok is a disaster but this kind of heavy handed blanket rule seems almost equally dystopian maybe im not smart enough to offer a perfect solution but i would like to see something that more forces companies to be consistent and open about their moderation criteria rather than throwing it out altogether i have been around long enough to see what happens on the internet when there are absolutely no rules and tbh it is a really low quality experience also unrelated but i will ask since i have not been able to post here for a while do any of you guys think the trump twitter ban issue is a bit of a self goal the president could honestly call a press conference in 2 minutes and have half of the world tune in but from the start he has bucked the tred by placing his main comm strategy in the hands of a private company and honestly while the banning itself and twitters enforcement are worthy of criticism the idea that the potus is deplatformed rings hollow in my ears either way let me know what you think and thanks for letting the outside join into the conversation every once in a whil,1

this is the only non flair required post i can find in the top ten like many other left leaning but more central redditors ive observed this sub for a while one recent common sentiment i ve seen really doesn t make sense to me so i ll break it down and i d love any more conservative voices to weigh in i totally get that the right feels there is hypocrisy in the coverage of the capital coup riot vs the blm protest riots what i don t get is the overall gravity of these things being directly equal in my perspective i see comments that basically say how can libs be so quiet when pocs who feel they are consistently murdered without a crime and then without justice for their killers often in uniform burn down a starbucks those on the left should really then not have a strong reaction when these trump supporters a stormed the capital at the direct suggestion of the sitting president due to fraud that no state has been able to back up b threw down the flag of our country and replaced it with that of a single politician c were allowed into the building by cops i know this brings up several different prongs but if i saw an article tomorrow that said one political party in iraq burned down a mall with no one in it because their tribe social group race was being murdered and another group got whipped up with no evidence into storming the capital i wouldn t see those as equal offenses or of equal validation motiv,1

why is so hard to accept that trump and his maga cult are not conservative they are extremist that views anyone not them as the enemy trump is no republican he s a failed dictator just cause you all are conservative doesn t mean you have to defend everyone with an r next to there nam,1
just so i understand you guys seriously don t think of trump as a possible dictator the guy who was been whining and wanting to shut down any company that dare speak out against him the guy that can t handle criticism and wants to solve all issues with suing the guy that faces zero consequences for his actions because he has successfully put people in power to protect him from so the guy who made up and successfully convinced his low iq believers that the election was rigged just because he hates losing the guy who praises dictators like putin and kim jong the guy that literally put his family without experience to run important government roles and has pardoned them before leaving office none of these traits are dictator traits to you guys come on as for big tech companies shutting all his accounts no shit think of it in reverse imagine joe biden starts preaching conspiracies and has riled up all the democrats to challenge democracy and advocates threatening anyone that disagrees with them and allows them to storm into government properties chanting to give joe another 4 years in office even if he clearly lost and now there s bomb threats for his opponents inauguration y all tell me what s most important here is joes freedom to spread violence and misinformation because freedom of speech isn t the republican party the party that is anti government yet when a private company sets down their rules y all are marching into the government to change that lol what,1

just dude poland is not the role model you should be holding up right now i thought conservatives were against communism kept out refugees is a funny one because they also rank refugees based on their ethinicity and its dependant on that how much of a welcome to you get its more accurate for you to say kept out muslims and gays fine a social justice warrior that is also a bit of a mis truth they will not fine someone who promotes some social justice they fine anyone who says anything that goes against government message but the government itself funds troll farms they also spent money on surveillance equipment to spy on telephones and computers i dunno how much poland fits with your values but if you hate elections they straight up cancelled their own elections and declared them unconstitutional they removed protections from ballots so you could just print one off at home and the police would legit have a hard time figuring out if its real or not a few short days before they were meant to have their elections they just straight up said that there were no candidates there were but then the elections were cancelled only 3 days later they created a civilian military within the ministry of defense and had generals answer to it full military generals answering to a 27yr old former pharmacy assistant with no higher education degree they made it illegal for judges to question the legionary of appointed people and skip over the questioning process before approval they can also fire judges at will and extend the retirement age of judges that they deem worthy they took over state media and made it a propaganda tube sure people may say that about american media but theirs calls any protest a coup and anyone who disagrees with the government is a paedophile defender which funnily enough is something the government did and still does when it comes to their catholic church tons of nepotism ex communists in power numerous scandals its too much to mention sorry its long but god there is so much wrong about holding poland on some ideological pedast,1

you really cannot if you want to learn from poland towards the 1st ammendment then you would take over state nd public media use it for propaganda and call any source of criticism a paedophile fire judiciaries at will and make it illegal for them to criticise other appointees sure they have freedom of speech so long as it is the right speech that they approve of,1
we should not run when tyranny makes it move we need to stay and fight it conservatives need to get clever we cannot post on theses forums anymore we need to decentralize communication as fast as we possibly can and form political action groups now the left is grabbing power consolidating the gains that they have made with propaganda and they are coming after free speech then the second amendment to disarm the people under the guise of security then the camps will start this is always how it goes with tyrants get ready it is coming and when it does you have your choices you can fight run or trade your freedom and dignity so that you can live on your knees they would sanction poland and infect the media like they always do tyranny is always better organized than liberty charles peguy,1

yes i agree that is certainly a valid approach and has its own pros and cons on the internet laws like this create an arms race for bots and troll farms social media sites can quickly be flooded with disinformation by whichever party seeks to influence a situation most in poland s case they are squeezed between the eu and russia and russia would love to spread disinformation unimpeded to the polish electorate and install russian friendly legislatures just like they did in ukraine tabloids cannot spam you with disinformation the way social media can and people shouldn t have to take everything they read online with the same level of skepticism that they take tabloids clearly poland wants it this way and more power to them hopefully it works but acting like they re aren t major risks to laws like this is shortsighted maybe they think the risks are worth it that s up to them,1
it is not going to work though combine bots with something like gpt 3 and all the threads are literally flooded with texts indistinguishable from what a person would write this would completely kill discussion boards like reddit,1

well is not the 1st amendment to do with the government suppressing free speech not big tech which just provides a broadcasting platform removing that does not suppress the actual right to speech just the ability to publicise it on mass in poland it is the actual government suppressing it in the form of making criticism illegal and calling any form of protest a coup and smearing any disagreement from individuals by calling them pedophile defenders in that case they are not removing the platform you use to speak but removing your ability to speak,1

it was banned many years ago when reddit started out it had a pretty clear intention of free speech with with the site wide rules would mostly be against illegal stuff and spam etc then it would be up to the subreddits to moderate content however subreddits like that popped up and after it showed up in traditional media and reddit became known for that content they moved away from the free speech idea and started to moderate the content more strictly so subreddits like that nazi subreddits etc has been banned also others that they deem hateful or otherwise hurtful and i guess that is where the slippery slope is i think parler or any other free speech community will need to figure out where that line is drawn because its users will be associated with the content as well and many do not want to use the same platform as jailbait people or nazis especially not after some news channel has done a deep dive on it,1
okay wanna show me proof how they can expulsion while a state can leave there is no provision for a state to be expelled but teu article 7 provides for the suspension of certain rights of a member state if a member persistently breaches the eus founding values these suspensions have to be unanimous which means that when they vote against hungary poland stops it when they vote against poland hungary stops it changes to funding also have to be unanimous and the same provisions apply they back each oth,1

what if none of those companies will sell to them is that a far fetched idea you are overthinking this when you get down to buying servers and parts you do not need a crazy contract licensing deal like you would with having a persistently hosted site with aws or microsofts azure platform if they have the money they could buy the stuff you do not need to explain yourself when you buy servers and they should source them from multiple places if they did not want large orders turning peoples heads that you are saying they need to support a lot of users so they cannot do this is very defeatist they do not need to get up to full capacity right away they could go so far as to turn the site invite only and semi private while they ramp up they could start small in scale just to get things tested and running fixing this does not mean flipping a switch and it is all back to normal expecting it to be quick and easy or else you give up is not how shit gets don,1
they stated they had around 300 500 servers on aws that is a lot but depending on what each server was doing that is only 10 12 racks of hardware if it is mostly processing plus a few racks for data storage getting that many servers within a month is absolutely doable give it another two weeks for deployment and testing as for whether or not retailers will sell to them just hire a contractor to do the work for you have douglastodd19 computer services buy the hardware and not have to worry about the parler name getting your orders canceled even building your own is feasible many servers can be bought and customized have done this many times myself it takes time and manpower but even the ebay listings alone for refurbished servers could cover their needs in the short run,1
sorry the leftists brigaded you lmao,1
you are overthinking this when you get down to buying servers and parts you do not need a crazy contract licensing deal like you would with having a persistently hosted site with aws or microsofts azure platform you would certainly need a contract to buy millions of dollars of hardware if they have the money they could buy the stuff they apparently cannot buy services from aws or azure you do not need to explain yourself when you buy servers as i said a large b2b transaction like this would require a written contract they may be able to create a corporation that parler would own to get around this so the company they are buying from does not know who they are really selling the hardware too that you are saying they need to support a lot of users so they cannot do this is very defeatist it is called being realistic why would i promote a plan that is not going to work they do not need to get up to full capacity right away they could go so far as to turn the site invite only and semi private while they ramp up sure but they have to quickly or they will lose the hype around their platform and they will be forgotten which is exactly what big tech wants expecting it to be quick and easy or else you give up is not how shit gets done i never said anything about giving up in order to fight back you need to recognize realities and take the best course of action based on them,1

interesting that this sort of sick extremism which was feared to occur as a result of president trump making executive orders etc never occurred because of anything president trump did the closest thing was this https www whitehouse gov briefings statements statement press secretary 010521 but that early january statement did not qualify political rallies of another opposing political party as somehow being domestic terrorism the actions and proposals of the democratic party would label opposing part ies expressions as terrorism creating a one party state in violation of the first amendment instead it was because of a combination of republicans losing the senate biden winning i use that term loosely the presidency and then with this newfound power that the dems realized or knew they would have as of jan 20 2021 to have control over house senate and presidency executive branch plus their existing relationships with big tech twitter facebook amazon google that this extremism occurred this extreme censorship and new defining of terrorism despite that the u s supreme court decisions and precedents protect political rallies as a form of first amendment speech of course it will not be long before the dems start threatening u s supreme court justices anew and possibly bully them into ruling against first amendment freedoms and in favor of defining specific political groups as domestic terrorists when we speak online or in person we have already seen schumer expressly threaten u s supreme court justices last year since the senate could very well go back to republican control in november 2022 i do not think that will work out very well for democrats who think that is a great long term strategy more likely it will result in fracturing of our internet and dissolution of platforms that could not survive the purges we are seeing now in 2021 and that does not bode well for anyone of any political strip,1

as a canadian this defeatist attitude is troubling to me americans have been known to take on much harder tasks than the current one before them where is the spirit that defeated the british against overwhelming odds where is the strength that defeated the democrat slavers during the civil war how about that national socialists ww2 would have been lost without the americans there are things that can be done to fight this for instance truckers can refuse to deliver amazon products until they stop playing politics i do not know if it would work but it can be tried being emotional thinkers and not logical ones this is why the progressive left is perfectly fine with their hypocrisy surrounding the riots this summer and the riot at the capitol they agreed with message of antifa and blm so it made them feel good while they disagreed with the message of trump followers so that made them angry logic dictates that either you accept violent protests for all sides or you accept them for none but logic has nothing to do with it their logic is determined by whether they agree with the message or not progressive lefties need to be made to feel that what they are doing to stifle freedom in america is wrong the only way that can happen in my opinion is to use their tactics against them companies with conservative ceos such as qualcomm can make it be known that they will not do business with progressive left wing companies the support the stifling of their ideological opponents at the state level conservatives can pressure the state governments for a convention of states like minded red states can band together to fight the democrats at every step at the local level conservatives can pressure their school boards their local governments etc to expel progressive lefties who support the use of corporate power to hurt conservatives failing that conservatives can run against progressive lefties at the local level cancel culture is abhorrent to me and i do not support it but the progressive left must be made to feel the pain of it so it can end conservatives in america must begin to flex their pow,1

funny thing about maga rallies they decried window smashers as antifa and wrestled them away multiple times a cop was assaulted by a couple of armed yahoos why are so many in bicycle helmets btw at the front trying to breach the doors and protestors came up from behind and dragged the assaulters off the cop to the cheers of the protesting crowd and when they declared a riot and sent everyone home people left even after the capitol police shot and killed an unarmed woman no days and days of nightly riots looting and arson across the country contrast all the leftist protests over 2020,1

ill weigh in as a non believer that grew up christian it would be far more appealing if the church stuck to its guns seeing a pope have this opinion is disturb,1
i appreciate that i just wanted to help you have clarity that what the pope says is not necessarily the opinion of all or even most catholics i find that people outside the faith are often confused about that point,1
thanks very much,1
of course it s more likely you d be abused by a family member everyone has a family member not everyone is catholic thats not really a fair debate but aside from that it s not the issue the specific position and celibacy is attractive to a certain group of men who have very deviant desires they have access to kids but here s the kicker thousands of complaints and allegations and the church for a very long time would shuffle priests into different positions and different geographic areas to avoid prosecution the church became the coverup vehicle and it s a problem,1

unfortunately i went to a liberal arts college not for the beliefs but because they had the major i wanted there was tons of pandering and things thrown at students including myself i will never forget my junior year i had to take a latin music course which i guess i had to take for credits towards my major the professor was from cuba originally and was in a latin music group i guess the class had to form groups and go to some salsa clubs and other latin music venues then write a group paper there were 5 of us in the group and i was the only caucasian after the venue tour which i was the driver we wrote the paper all of us put our reports in the paper i wrote about 5 pages and the others 2 3 pages the professor had no idea who wrote what part i thought we would get a group grade but we each got individual grades the other 4 members received as while i received a c come to find out other caucasian members in the class received a c too while non caucasians got as i complained to the higher ups about it but they just told me to let it go that was 20 years ago i would hate to see what professors do now with students with a conservative mindset,1

yes about that i doubt there ll be that many that will fight like that when the draconian gun laws start being passed this year,1
lol is it really snowing in se texas that is awesome i think like most people everyone really just wants to know the truth everyone has feelings that stuff isn t quite right up there in washington especially when people like epstein just walk out of prison years ago and later it s proven he had connections with the world elite and was involved in some bad bad stuff,1

like that ever stopped a tech company befor,1
i ve often heard this is this a specific excuse that actually gets you out of it,1
i think the pope rumor may have been started because some users saw a possible police car in a live stream i don t see anything other than that one person wrote a blog about it because it s seen from his apartment and that it was a street sweeper and he has no reason to believe the blackout arrests etc all just internet rumors i m sure some clarity will be provided soon but i m not seeing anything that lends credibility to either rumor as of yet,1

give that man two promotions and a raise i hope biden appoints him to a position in police reform and gives him a presidential medal of freedom,0
this is amazing true hero but it is also extremely fucked up that we are in a state in which a black man has to act like bait to get radical racists to go after him like zombies so that they don t kill senators that won t back a coup by trump,0
this man is nothing short of a hero he saved lives while risking his own there are a lot of noble police officers out there that is why we need to fund the police better so we can have better training and more great police offic,0

i hate trumptards as much as the next guy but my conservative friends and family are overwhelmingly disapproving of the murder of the police officer for some of them they even approved of the riot until they found out an officer died that changed their tune still the party of blue lives matter and it is an unfair distribution of blame to hold the entire party accountable for one murder in terms of being blue lm that being said they are all fucking shitlords for putting trump in a position to do this and should all be held very accountable for doing so,0
black lives matter founders the first thing i think is that we actually do have an ideological frame myself and alicia in particular are trained organizers we are trained marxists we are super versed on sort of ideological theori,0
worse than we d all like to think about,0
you seem to imply he does not deserve it this guy is human of the year he may not want a new home for himself or a loved one but if he does i am going to help him get it,0
we need good cops in the field to do good work and set examples for others in the field but we also need them in leadership positions to train cops below them and change policies that s how you tackle the systemic structural problems in police forces right,0
imagine thinking acknowledging someone s race means you aren t treating them as a person,0
it s important to recognize the contributions that poc make to american society including the protection of the republic you just sound mad that your coup fail,0
because of systemic racism there is this perception that black youth cannot rise above the poverty and crime they stereotyped to be stuck in we need paragons like this officer to show them not only that they can but that it is also noble and they will be recognized and applauded for their effort,0
because white supremacists stormed the capitol,0
fair point,0
are you certain of that objective i have not seen that reported edit i found the reference to the story makes sense with the context,0
the conservatives i know are pretty silent not one condemnation from them not even outrage over the murder of two police offic,0
i didn t say he doesn t deserve it but he s also not strapped for cash based solely on salary info i m just not a fan of rushing out to setup gofundmes for everyone and anyone i hope that biden recognizes his service and presents him with a medal of some kind and i hope that stories of other capitol police officers doing similar things come out but we don t have to immediately jump to throwing a bunch of money at a guy that could really complicate his life if done wrong,0
normally yes but these aren t normal times we need to see heroes in the streets and among the people right now people don t have a whole lot of trust in the police on the streets right now changing a police chief doesn t change that in the short term seeing the cops you have seen do the right thing like this out and about doing their job is absolutely critical right now,0
youre 100 right nothing will change unless the heads of these organizations and the supervisors chang,0
yikes saying i supported the coup because i have a different viewpoint than you i think you need to take a look at yourself,0
lmao you re not doing anything by applauding a black person for doing their actual job on reddit take action stop thinking your doing some valiant and courageous shit by speaking about these things on reddit when you should be going to your local political offices and taking it up with them this right here is pathet,0
you saw like one or two confederate flags and think they re all white supremacists i m guessing the assumption that some of them were white supremacists shouldn t change anything it s silly to say black people saved american democracy once again because of that it s like saying white people saved american democracy by stopping slavery it s silly and completely unnecessary to make this about race edit on top of that there were a bunch of white officers even one who died during this but were going to pick out one black officer and make this entire thing about race it s just silli,0

the people who stormed the capitol are the exact same people who say those kind of things though if that s not you then i apologize but black people came out in record numbers for biden and that cemented his victory frankly we should be recognizing that they largely saved our republic this election cycle why is that wrong,0
be careful typically your a racist bigot if you have any difference in opinion i don t think theyre awake yet,0
this is one of those what you are doing does not matter or have an impact so you should be doing x and y instead so that your doing something that matters conversations but everything matters not just the big stuff but the small stuff too as it all adds up i know your just being critical of the political activism by blog post generation but i would like to point out that young voters came out in record numbers to vote in georgia and i am sure some of them were inspired by the things they read on the internet just as much by political leaders change does not simply start at the top and trickle its way down it starts with the private conversations we have with friends and family the type of of things we joke about or the sentiment we express it works it is way up to the water cooler talks we have at work to the type of policies we put into place in the private and public sector to the memes we generate on the internet so when you say it does not matter everything matters from the bottom up to voting and marching in the streets we thought a bunch of crazies on the internet talking about lizard people does not matter well apparently it matters a lot as it resulted in a lone black police officer holding off a mob of a bunch of crazies trying to attack our democraci,0

why aren t they being charged as complicit this is on them they stoked and charged and poked an irritated bear they catterwauled long and loud about a stolen election they amplified trumps rhetoric to an angry base these republicans helped the momentum helped stoke the anger and did so without fear of repercussions know why they ve watched this last year devolve into lawlessness all of the people that just skipped impeachment trials just straight up obstructed straight ignored subpoenas and went about their merry day and what happened nan nothing just some finger wagging know what happens if i get a subpoena and just ignore it a warrant for my arrest but republicans get a pass for all of the damage they ve caused this country fuck that if these politicians are not held accountable for their complicity then a precedent is being set and it will be very hard to ever go back from that this is not a third world country this is america we are letting the republican party create their own al qaeda that will just off the competition the republicans listed here are terrorists plain and simple they should be treated as such and this is all bc the liberals let a black man be president twice that s how deep the hatred and racism run it s disgusting they need to be held accountable the fucking off duty officers that were there from different parts of the country also need to be held accountable that dude with the zip ties is scary as fuck bc why why the military looking outfit why did he need zip ties to peacefully protest bet this incident was waaaaay too close to the start of a handmaid s tale for my comfort the republicans here are terrorists they should be treated as such,0

i worry that many on the left may do the same wrong thing that many on the right have been doing for years wild speculation at every little thing and drastic overreaction i got to see the other side of it for years as my fox news watching father made ridiculous claim after ridiculous claim of shit that was a massive overreaction or just flat out being misled because fox news is really not news i worry that we may see that in reverse where people get spoon fed by cnn or msnbc which let us be honest are sometimes pretty bad with sensationalism in their own right and start pulling hard to the left,0
outrage culture has taken full control of peoples hearts that is the problem rs think that biden and pelosi are plotting against america ds think every r is a criminal and should be locked up killed people have just become too angry and are imo refusing to slow down and cool off for a bit,0
but nothing about what she said was secret it s clear what her intent was and that could get her in trouble but she wasn t telling anyone something that wasn t already known other than maybe being out there a bit faster than media was reporting it,0
you are making the assumption that what she said was intentional and that she was not just being a dimwit i am not saying that she had no intention to assist the insurrectionists i do not really know of course that may be for a grand jury to decide based on evidence much of which we may not have seen but you literally have folks in here calling for her execution which is some thedonald bullshit i expect that shit from subs like td and conservatives not here we should be better than that,0
no doubt,0
republicans would have argued that it would be divisive to prosecute h,0
well why tf would they even put a false headline then and you should know by now not everyone reads the articl,0
there is really no proof though that the two tweets made prove conspiracy to commit murder if there had been something more like hey yall nancy just went out the west hall or something more specific than the speaker has been removed from the chamber i would tend to agree but there is nothing in the two tweets that was not also broadcast on the major news networks and nothing that was actually inflammatory you will not get a conviction or impeachment removal from office based on those two tweets alone she is a despicable human being but we should focus on getting her out by way of the next us house election cycle rather than by trying to make out these tweets as proof that she is culpable of murder if there is more evidence that she helped incite the insurrection or aid and abet the people who stormed the building then lock her ass up but trying to go after her for these two tweets is not going to get what you w,0

it s a single tweet in which she says the speaker has been removed from the house chamber the rioters surely knew the uscp would remove her as soon as the building was breached if not before she didn t tweet the location of the speaker she tweeted one location where she was not,0
yes she tweeted that they were locked in the house chambers letting the seditionist know the location of the house members and presumably the speak,0
my thoughts exactly it is not that i expect much from a q supporter but the two tweets she used could simply to show how scared she was let us leave conspiracy theories to the mob and focus on facts as sane peopl,0
at this point if we have to tell the fbi about her then i dont really have any faith in the fbi ability to do there job,0
nobody gives a fuck now,0
they have secure locations all over only some of which are public fort mcnair and mount weather are common knowledge even to foreign pow,0
i agree with you that this representative should not be imprisoned technically the punishment for actively committing sedition is death,0
kinda funny if pence was killed nancy would be next president if trump was removed forcibly i think they were trying to get nancy first though,0
she also charged too high prices for sweat,0
hmm ok to be honest that doesn t seem as bad as i was think,0
the chamber has c span cameras and there were a few hundred people in there before the speaker was taken away she wasn t spilling a secret anyone else couldn t have spilled the speaker s use of that room during a session is not the least bit secret it was shown on live tv just before the storming so tweeting that location isn t revealing a secret and it doesn t appear boebert tweeted anything about where they took pelosi after that point now that would ve been a security breach but tweeting that the speaker is in her chair during a session is like tweeting that santa claus sits at the mall in december i get that this woman is a nut and clearly sympathetic to violent protesters but critics will need a stronger case than this to see her expelled or prosecut,0
charge too much for sweaters jail charge too little for sweaters also jail,0
i agree with you she is a nut to be sure but people are overreacting a bit hell i was watching footage of the chamber when she sent the first tweet if the second tweet revealed pelosis location it would be a huge problem but it did not it simply stated one location where she was not i have a major problem with the fact that she was assisting the insurgents at all however there simply is not enough information here to know whether the second tweet was a criminal act i also have a major problem with her voting to overturn a fair election but she was not alone in this i get that emotions are high but i think that we need to be careful about jumping to conclusions too,0
people should also consider that this woman like that nut from georgia and at least a dozen of her house colleagues wants this kind of attention she wants you to hate her pursue her pick fights with her that s her entire reason for being in politics to pick fights she s not there to make anyone s life better but her own and she will only achieve that goal if she becomes the full time fox sponsored liberal target she s branded herself as don t take her bait if she committed an offense let justice be done but don t give her too much of your own attention follow the example of house democrats like john lewis jim cooper annie kuster deb haaland etc those people see public service as a way to help others to solve problems and build a better country they wouldn t give this moron the satisfaction of a flashy slap fight they d concentrate on their work and their solutions and leave this fool in the dark where she belong,0

yeah he did,0
dude a baby is smarter he was like oh they certainly wont recognize me without my beard well man a beard is not only recognizable but a face is also if he wanted to really not get caught there is nothing he can do other than use a clown mask or something but that wouldnt work too since why would you go outside and see someone wearing a clown mask without a reason,0
get em nancy it s clear that the vp and cabinet are not going to move forward with 25a,0
he betrayed america complet,0
there needs to be some kind of emergency response that enables congress to remove a sitting president immediately in the event he or she commits crimes like this one did on wednesday the fact that he is still in office five days later is appalling reckless and scary relying on a vp to invoke the 25th is inadequate because the two were elected together the congress and or the supreme court with a simple majority should have the power to invoke the 25th just as well as the vp because our government is composed of three coequal branches and one branch should be able to stop any other branch in an emergency even if only short term so an investigation can take place also i understand that if a person commits a felony and during the commission of that felony a person dies they can and should be held responsible and charged with manslaughter if not murd,0

his name is ted the spineless,0
he was at trump s rally earlier making some comment about standing up themselves so he needs to be held responsible and sent to prison,0
expel him,0
what is kinda funny is he was almost certainly doing what he did only to boost his 2024 chances but he may have killed his career instead,0
hopefully he s referred to as a prisoner soon,0

impeachment is decided by congress we need to start respecting our system of government again i believe that s why joe is strong on calling out trump s crimes for what they are but less willing to speak on a potential impeach,0
sorry joe wtf is this talking about when did biden ever say he would not punish trump or would stand in the way of punishing him,0
or his enablers professional or civilian,0
i agree with joe impeachment is weak tea and makes democrats look ineffective as it is going no where with republicans unlikely to support it in sufficient numbers trump needs to arrested and put in jail immediately removed but it cannot happen until after trump is officially out,0
decisions here are going to put joe biden in abe lincolns role or andrew johnsons role one presiding over a civil war and the other over reconstruct,0
right he is president elect not his role to demand any action from congress or pence and it is not his job to direct his ag to investigate or prosecute anyone i support the democrats and biden because i do not want to be the party where the leaders chant lock him up,0
it s important to remember that impeachment was popular last year the trick that republicans have pulled is minoritarian rule the majority of americans don t matter under that system,0
i am leaving it up to the pros who know the laws to decide what to do i just want him out of our lives whether it is jail impeachment or whatever i am sick of him trying to control my lif,0

i am a firm believer that the internet and social media have been very detrimental to our society in so many ways and there is no turning back,0
there is nothing about net neutrality that would have prevented deplatforming net neutrality regulation is about regulating your isp to prevent limit rent seek you from accessing your favorite platform,0
reverse the decision to regulate the internet regulation is censorship reversing regulation means no censorship keep up the good work imbecil,0
neutrality means to be non partisan net neutrality big tech had to remain neutral now that those regulations are gone big tech can deplatform anyone they want it s not illegal for them to be bias anymore i ll remind you no conservative ever got de platform es during obamas administration en net neutrality was still in plac,0
this must be what it s like to think you know everyth,0
net neutrality had zero to do bias or de platforming even when we had net neutrality people were de platformed it was a gift to streaming giants preventing isps from charging them more while being a tax for us transform the internet from a virtually unregulated private system of networks into a quasi public utility subject to conflicting common carrier precedents bureaucratic designs and interminable waiver proceedings right now some private companies out of many are choosing to censor conservatives the ftc can punish and fine those companies if they choose but conservatives are still on internet with net neutrality the internet being a regulated utility the single government would have full power to censor,0
choosing to censor conservatives is a funny way of saying choosing not to provide a platform for terrorists to plan attacks on congress,0
so sad that so many in blm protest were tear gas and rubber bullets and arrested and yet the jan 6 crowd took iron bars to an officers body and fox calls that peaceful fox needs to held accountable for their li,0
imo protesting for equality against police brutality and for getting justice for an american citizen whose life was taken unlawfully by law enforcers is much more patriotic than storming a government building because their dear leader lost the election i gotta go further and say there is nothing patriotic with trumpers storming the capitol building we can even call them traitors since there was neo nazis and confederacy flag bearers inside the group,0
yes for the last five years fox news has knowingly poisoned the minds of millions of viewers against our democracy all to sell clicks and advertising slots thanks to fox a huge segment of the us population is now completely unmoored from reality and we are beginning to suffer the consequences fox needs to be brought to account in a manner as profound as the harm they have caus,0

actually people now are calling for the removal of the republican party from government and social media companies are removing conservatives from their platforms did you see any of that when democrats encouraged the burning of federal buildings looting of stores killing of police and lockdowns of cities no the ccp which is justifying fucking concentration camps is still allowed on twitter there is an iranian official that has called for the destruction of the western world by iran several times guess if he is banned or not is biden going to be impeached because he supported riots that killed dozens of police officers no why the double standard,0

not really a lot of people on that sub criticize trump and other republicans like mitch mcconnell a lot and open and free sub is that why i get downvoted to hell every time i bring up a good point that people can t respond to the fact that you switch subjects to how i haven t gotten banned instead of responding to my actual comment shows how you guys have no answers and are just massive hypocrit,0

i was so shocked when i saw that sweatshirt and then i just cried he has no idea what he is professing he was literally wearing his ignorance on his chest that was just disgust,0
previously work,0
i beg to differ he knows exactly what he is professing it is completely meaningless unless you understand what is behind it can anyone name just one japanese internment camp assuming you did not have relatives in one no there is something very special about auschwitz and bergen belsen and sobibor and everybody knows what it is that was just the first 3 off the top of my head and that is just general knowledge stuff,0
i should have explained myself better sorry yes i know he knows what he is professing what he believes he does not because of his ignorance know the truth about what his sweatshirt says he does not know that it is wrong and vicious and cruel to wear something like that it is ignorant that is what i meant sorry my relatives were at manzanar,0
thank you i will do my best to remember that name we cannot forget lest we repeat it may not be auschwitz but it is on the road to it a road america has traveled too many tim,0
manzanar was nothing like auschwitz even the comparison is ridiculous and it was a democratic president who put them there ironically it was a repubican president who actually did something to make ammends as a democrat i have always remembered this because it teaches us that racism as neither rhyme or reason,0
i did not compare the two i said it was on the road to it figuratively speaking a road america has traveled since it was just a trail and if i was going to make it a political statement i would point out that neither the republican or democratic parties represent what they did even fifty years ago the two parties have completely reversed polar,0

im fine with them being labeled as terrorists but they deserve to have a trial and not in their small town municipal court i mean in a dc federal court because the punishment should fit the crime they should be arrested with bail,0
they need to be put on trial you mean the patriot act was passed during gw bush it basically strips any constitutional rights by perceived terrorists they dont get their day in court i dont support these mobs militias terrorists at all nor die i support or like any of those bastard cops or congress that were at this march however its their right to have a fair and speedy tri,0
