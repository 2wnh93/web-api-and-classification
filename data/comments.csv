Except their lawyers have dropped Parler as a client.,Conservative
Republicans had six years to do something about big tech and did nothing.,Conservative
/r/news has been celebrating all day. They love it.,Conservative
I wish him luck but what can he do at this point? These Big Tech giants are way more powerful and influential. Parler by comparison is the ultimate underdog.,Conservative
If Twitter can do anything because they are a private company then the rest of business can be open and do what they want,Conservative
"Not a wise course of action - these corporations are behemoths and can afford to tie up Parler in law fare for years.

He should focus on finding new servers and then working on a long term solution to this deplatforming threat.",Conservative
"Idk why you all think this is a cut and dry issue with an obvious answer. Plus, I thought you all stood for small government and allowing corporations to choose who they do business with? I mean fuck, if you guys aren’t then I’m on the wrong subreddit. This subreddit is r/Conservative not r/DonaldTrump or even r/Republican .. have some god damn standards.

If you were of the opinion that the wedding cake business owners should not be forced to serve that gay couple but you’re for the government stepping in here... you’re a hypocrite. Same goes for the opposite case in r/Politics",Conservative
"1. stop buying apple, they don't let you side load
2. don't panic, you can use the parler website. if the pirate bay can get hosting, so can parler
3. this is good because the more it happens the more people leave big tech
4. the more control big tech exerts over distribution the less they control distribution
4. don't give up your principle that you can decide who your customers are",Conservative
There was a thing a little while back where poland would fine social media platforms for political censorship,Conservative
"I mean, this is coordinated anticompetitive behavior.  That just screams antitrust.",Conservative
I just talked to a friend of mine who thinks there is absolutely nothing wrong with what big tech is doing. He also defended the riots all last year but is now saying the right is out of control. I am genuinely confused how people can support this stuff. What a time.,Conservative
"I would really love to download Parler, except for them forcing me to give them my telephone number. I'll sit here in silence, with my privacy more intact.",Conservative
"Time to decentralize.  Redevelop to host on decentralized platforms.  Use the technology storj/sia use.  They cannot shit down all of is.  Besides, a social media platform that doesn’t spy on user activity is a threat to big tech",Conservative
On what grounds? Our leftist tech overlords write the terms and conditions,Conservative
Strongest case that I haven't heard anyone say yet is a tortious interference claim,Conservative
"Surely someone with money in America still has principles and cares about free speech.

Right?",Conservative
"Companies like Apple et al have nearly infinite monies, and legions of lawyers, to fight this type of suit. I hope Parler prevail, but somehow I think they will go bankrupt before they even see the inside of a courtroom.",Conservative
"Has anyone seen proof of Parler being directly responsible for the storming of the Capitol? We keep seeing how they are a collection of hate groups gathering, yet I’ve yet to see any posts indicating they engage in Nazism.

Seems to me they are the perfect scapegoat for all this violence just because Trump has been banned from Twitter. 

If I get banned from all social media, so be it. I grew up in the 80s and 90s and got along great without it. I can live without people knowing my every waking thought and opinion. Too bad not everyone can say the same.",Conservative
There is no denying it was a coordinated attack on such a fast schedule as to prevent any chance of them stopping it.,Conservative
"Yeah I'm sure a white guy who runs a free speech website is going to be treated 100% fairly by the legal system and win a major landmark case.

lol

We aren't living in reality here. He's a second-class citizen from a global (and newly landless) microminority and his filings will be laughed at.",Conservative
"I feel bad for him. This is pissing me off way more than twitter banning people.

I feel like this is very anti competetive behavior. They basicly have a monopoly on social media",Conservative
As long as he stays humble and open to free discussion on his platform he will be insanely wealthy in no time!!,Conservative
Best of luck to them. The tech companies are so powerful and they have the government (aka The Party) on their side. I wish them the best.,Conservative
"It's unbelievably hypocritical that Google, Twitter, and Facebook benefit so much from and fight so hard to preserve the legal protection from being held liable for what users post on their platforms and then turn around and pull this shit on their competitors. In what world could it be legal for them to act like this? It's clear and objective anti-trust violations. Google is a vertical monopoly and is abusing this to remain a horizontal monopoly. Time for some good old fashioned trust busting.",Conservative
"That should take...wait a minute, a decade",Conservative
"Big tech has censored and banned the actual President of the United fucking States of America.  Look I'm all for the rights of private companies to do as they please but when these companies grow to the size and scope of utilities, its changes the game a little.  What if the power companies could deny service to people they didn't like?  (they can't).  These huge media companies like Apple, Facebook, Twitter, Google, Etc...they function almost as utilities at this point and being unable to use them is a crazy blow to any company that relies on their services.  This whole thing is nuts.",Conservative
"What a shame. It's astonishing how the Left celebrates censorship, what has this country come to? 

I hope Parler finds its way back in the app store or something.",Conservative
"racketeering and anti-trust hoooooooo

this is the bed you made, leftists. say goodbye to your indoctrination platforms",Conservative
Is Gab seriously the only alternative to Parler?,Conservative
[removed],Conservative
"If nothing else, this seems like a alarm over Amazon Web Services. No company can seemingly exist on the internet without them.

What's that word for when a single company controls the market to the point of being anti-competitive?",Conservative
"Whacking a hornet's nest with a stick.

This is not gonna end well. So much for ""unity"" eh Michelle?",Conservative
I'm slamming Amazon's chat line this morning with shit and will continue to do so.  Hope others will consider doing the same.,Conservative
This is only going to piss more people off,Conservative
"It's crazy as shit to me that we have one side of the great political divide that is just a-okay with completely undermining free speech so political opinions they disagree with are silenced. Like I can't stand the bullshit some liberals say, but I'd fight for their right to say it... What the fuck is happening to our country? Where does this madness stop?",Conservative
Collision amongst the monopoly 'players'.,Conservative
"I hate parler and it's dumb. I fully fully support this and hope we can open up the internet as a utility. Fuck these censoring scumbags making the same Jim Crow era arguments to ban people they dislike from modern life on the internet.

Shit I'd be a card carrying ACLU member if they supported gun rights.",Conservative
"Its technofascism and racketeering. Twitter, Google, Amazon, and Apple are colluding to forcibly shut down businesses that compete with them.",Conservative
"If gays can force you to make them a wedding cake then conservatives can force you to host their app as long as nothing on it is illegal.

EDIT: oh, you ninnies don't like the use of the word ""gays"" because you're afraid it's offensive so I get downvotes?  Well, I've had plenty of gay sex in my life, so I'm talking about myself and I'm free to do that, you SJWs punks.  My point stands, and it's a good one, the legal argument works the same.",Conservative
"It's gonna get interesting.. 

I think the problem lies in the ubiquity of platforms like twitter and facebook and their uniform rejection of people on the right. Yet they retain a casual disregard for anything that might be akin to ""incitement"" on the left. Can you imagine investing your time and resources in an app and then being told your app can be of no use because too many people might have voted for trump that use it?

If the personal and political get so wedded it will not be pleasant for anybody in the middle",Conservative
That is good to hear.,Conservative
"Their best bet is for Epic Games lawsuits against Apple and Google to succeed. Even then, the app is likely not getting back on those app stores in its current state.",Conservative
TRUST BUST,Conservative
I hope it’s another Sandman-level win,Conservative
"He has a couple items he probably has a chance with.  First, the coordination is obvious, and it's extremely anti-competitive.  Second, that they made press releases about it publicly.  This is ""blacklisting"" of a form, and I haven't read the press releases themselves, but could be an area of trouble for big tech.",Conservative
"Well, it’s time to use it against them.  Portray them as the Larry of censorship.  Then they try to go to conservative sites ban them.  Get a movement going to break up the monopolies.  Dump Amazon, Facebook, IG and others.  Actively campaigns against them",Conservative
Scatter their ashes in the wind,Conservative
"Wait, where's that one graphic about you can't have my space, wait you can't have your space.... itsallsotiresome.gif

But seriously: you can't share ideas online. And you can't demonstrate or lash out in real life. In fact, we'd rather you whither and die and we'll give you opioids in order to do it...",Conservative
"Don’t y’all love the dm’s from the left politics side we are getting? Cracks me up the messages they send like dude, you’re the one taking your time writing three paragraph message that I don’t even look at, so much time on hands, just want a debate over nonsense.",Conservative
"BIG TIME LAWSUIT

Actions to deny/interfere with  commerce of competitors

The dems will quash it - but just more evidence against this leftist regime",Conservative
"So if AWS blocks a web platform because of content that a user posts, doesn’t that mean that they endorse all content from those they don’t block?  On Reddit lefty subs alone there’s endless supplies of racism and death threats.  AWS endorses these I guess.",Conservative
The left really stepped in it this time,Conservative
I look forward to the day Matze is the new Woody Harrelson wiping his tears with cash.,Conservative
Plenty more lawyers,Conservative
I guarantee there is a coalition of Peter Thiel style billionaires hiring the best lawyers in the country for this.  Probably starting with Randaza out of Vegas.,Conservative
"Pelosi personally went to every lawyer in the nation for a ""spoil"" consultation, being a secret fan of Sopranos.",Conservative
well now Sane America has been shown what enemies of freedom these collborators with tyranny now are,Conservative
"Those morons keep denying that this is censorship, completely forgetting that corporate censorship is a thing.

It's strange, because usually those on the Left are highly concerned with the amount of power massive corporations have over the public. You'd think they'd be appalled, and yet they're applauding it.",Conservative
[removed],Conservative
This is how democracy ends. With thunderous applause.,Conservative
[deleted],Conservative
"their mods probably do too, seeing as they perma-ban conservatives for being conservative. it's impressive how they manage to run their sub even worse than rpolitics.

they used to be a pretty neutral community, not sure if the current POS mods are new or if they just couldn't handle that the sub didn't represent their vision of how people should think.",Conservative
It's natural for authoritarians. They don't care what happens or how many rights they lose as long as the authortarians crush their political rivals first. They could be told that they will be getting shot tomorrow and would happily agree with it if it meant they get to watch their enemies shot today.,Conservative
They love corporations controlling their lives.,Conservative
Of course they do.  Fascists applaud fascist policy.,Conservative
Wait till the big tech companies lose.,Conservative
"They’re celebrating attacking freedom of speech?

This isn’t even America anymore.",Conservative
Wait I thought Amazon and Bezos were the enemies....,Conservative
"Courts rarely care about politics. They care about the law. Parler is backed by some extremely wealthy people.
I’d like to see the aclu step in as well.",Conservative
"If Microsoft can be sued for stifling Netscape then then I don’t see why Apple, Google and Amazon can’t be sued for shutting down Parler. I haven’t seen anything on Parler as bad as what I’ve seen on Twitter.

"It is protected by the same laws that Twitter and Facebook take advantage of. So naturally we get to watch the democrats strip away at 230 protections to get rid of parler, which will in turn put checks on Twitter and Facebook.",Conservative
[removed],Conservative
"It's less a ""twitter can do what they want"" and more of a ""the government can't tell companies how to regulate political speech under current law"" issue. Corporations like Twitter can be regulated, but not in ways that infringe on their constitutional rights. The courts have ruled that shutting down businesses for legitimate public safety concerns is constitutional, although it's up to the government to prove that there are legitimate public safety concerns, and that their actions aren't discriminatory.

In other words, this issue requires a legislative solution. The courts really can't do anything, and we shouldn't aspire to rule by judicial or executive fiat anyway.",Conservative
"Bake the cake, right?",Conservative
They have no principles. Confirmation bias all the way.,Conservative
Is that not how we already operate?,Conservative
Small businesses aren’t rich enough to lobby congress. That’s the difference,Conservative
"The problem is that if nobody DOES anything they’ll do it again. And right here is a perfect moment to strike back against these assholes, sure they won’t be hurt that much but still better than bending the ass to take another hit.",Conservative

">He should focus on finding new servers and then working on a long term solution to this deplatforming threat. 

If it's not a hosting service, next time it'll be the upstream provider. It's not going to end.",Conservative
"Maybe im an old, old, OldTimer.  But this all brings up memories of Radio Free Europe.",Conservative
This is the correct answer,Conservative
"This. A business has the right to deny service based on their policies. They should find other servers/services if they want to continue to operate, instead of wasting resources pretending thet can overcome what is very solid legal ground for tech services companies.",Conservative
Hard to find new servers while Amazon and Google are threatening every service provider around.,Conservative
well WE THE PEOPLE might have a GREAT DEAL to say about it.,Conservative
"They have nothing to lose and everything to gain. If they don't they are done, if they lose they are done, if they win they move forward.",Conservative

"thats a law put in place by the government itself

you think biden&co now OR pelosi&co before   would do anything when it was going their way down the path of their control?",Conservative

Phone numbers used to be listed in a book that got delivered to every home in the county. This is your sticking point??,Conservative
"Wish this comment was higher. I've been thinking the same thing as you while reading through all the replies. Decentralize, decentralize, decentralize. Throw in some skywire in the mix too. (Decentralized internet for the uninformed)",Conservative
Probably anti trust that Twitter directly worked with apple and Microsoft to de platform its leading competitor,Conservative
"> On what grounds? Our leftist tech overlords write the terms and conditions

worth mentioning, terms and conditions don't supersede the law. these tech companies have a habit of putting lots of illegal and unenforceable crap in their terms and conditions that would never stand up in court. (look at the various articles about ""warranty stickers"" on video game consoles for an example of this). these companies just bank on the fact nobody will challenge them.",Conservative
"when they block you at every turn it is hard

I've personally seen one dumb comment by lin wood and other than that I seen FAR more comments made on Twitter and Facebook about the stop steal the Parler.,Conservative

Excuse my pessimism but if the Supreme Court didn’t do anything about the election then they definitely won’t help Parler,Conservative

Ew...,Conservative

"Maybe you dont understand that its a sanctuary from the leftist-though-police that run those other platforms?

"They only care when it happens to them.

Edit: sorry brigaders. Quit trying and maybe go back to your pathetic little lives?",Conservative
"More accurately it’s Sherman Act. They’re shutting down one company/customer (Parler) by claiming terms of service violation, while letting another (Twitter) violate those same terms. There is violent rhetoric on both sides. Planning and coordination of “protests” on both sides. You can’t have one without the other. You can’t say one is x and the other isn’t. 

It’s conspiracy to create a monopoly for Twitter by colluding to shut down their competition.",Conservative
"It’s sad how they seem to not think social media companies and big tech wouldn’t be operating in the exact same manner against left leaning groups if the incoming government was majority conservative and blamed their platforms for allowing a violent act on the capitol. Yes it’s extra convenient for big tech because they do politically align with the left, but their first mission is to remain in their overwhelmingly powerful, monopoly, too big to fail status at all costs. Whenever there is the threat of possible legislation, actual updating anti-trust/competition law to be better in regards to the digital economy, etc they will do whatever they can to be seen as being on the right side of things. 

It’s extra ironic that the “they are private companies and can do what they want” line is being used by the left here on Reddit who decry that free-market capitalism every chance they get, but this is far from a free market. take Parler for example, it’s not tens of millions of Americans boycotting them because they actually did something bad that’s causing their collapse, they aren’t failing because of legitimate legal enforcement for breaking the law, they literally went from being one of the most downloaded applications in the planet to overnight not existing because less than a dozen tech companies that provide the cloud and servicing infrastructure needed to exist colluded to kill the competition of their friends over at Twitter and facebook, that should terrify everyone.....",Conservative
"When have they been highly concerned about the amount of power massive corporations have over the public? Might be my Gen Z showing, but they’ve been handing over their liberties on a platter to Big Daddy Megacorporations as long as I can remember",Conservative
"At the same time they are thinking they are anti-establishment.

It's funny to see.",Conservative
"They're genuinely stupid enough that they don't realize that their entire political party is made up of and relies on massive corporations.  They still think the Democrats are the party of the little guy, the average working-class American.  Couldn't be further from the truth.  The people running their party are a bunch of rich CEOs and politicians who've made a fortune through backdoor deals.
    
They don't see it as censorship because they think big tech is just cleaning out the racists, domestic terrorists, and bigots.  You have to realize, the left indoctrinates their followers to think of anyone who disagrees with them as subhuman.  To them, what big tech is doing to us is the same as taking out the trash or stepping on a bug.",Conservative
"Because the TV told them to. Bunch of sheep. I question everything , even Trump.",Conservative

would be nice to see fox lend them some good lawyers and support seeing as the left is already feeling emboldened by their recent war on free speech and have clearly set their sights on fox as their next target. 

it's kind of like the statue debate last summer. regardless of how people felt about the statues themselves, smart people knew that going after the statues of confederate generals was merely a stepping stone to removing the founding fathers. fast forward a few months, and that's exactly what they started doing.

fox might have pissed a lot of people off the last few months, but it's a safe bet they can see the writing on on the wall for what these left wing totalitarians are planning.",Conservative
I don’t think so either. I imagine Amazon would have a clause in their contract giving them the right to terminate the service if certain conditions are met. They’d merely argue in court that they had been met and gave fair warning of the cancellation.,Conservative
Potentially antitrust? I mean the collusion between these companies meets the standards for anti trust. But from my understanding the Governmwnt would have to bring that to court,Conservative

What happened to Conservativism being for SMALL government..? I mean I hate censorship just as much as anyone else but these are private companies. Nothing is stopping Parler from hosting it on different servers. If the business is there, then it’s there.

If it's a civil lawsuit and they can prove that Amazon targeted them for political reasons they could sue for damages. This isn't about someone getting ripped off with a bad product for service this is literally destroying a private business just because they allow free speech. Sure they probably won't win but they have to do something. This could open the door for a class action lawsuit filed by other companies that have been effecticely canceled by companies that have near monopolies in large sections of the tech markets.

Staples and OfficeMax if you don’t remember we’re trying to merge after losing nearly all of their market share to Amazon and Walmart online, a merger would have saved a few thousand jobs I think, but the DOj blocked it because they’d have a monopoly of office supply stores, despite the fact that combined they were still less than like 20% of total sales in this area, and even the direct to office wholesale market was smaller than Amazon’s and Walmart’s.",Conservative

So when someone sees something on opposite ends of the spectrum from themselves, it's seems unbelievable or *not normal*...and that makes people uncomfortable. In turn, they avoid it. 

Look at the citizens & politicians who have had their heads stuck in the sand during past years. It's not because they didn't see it. It's because they did see it, and didn't want to acknowledge it. Why? The truth can be ugly. It causes people to consider & possibly react, and most are just too beat down and discouraged to want to do that. It's easier to convince yourself that your mistaken than to have to fight something contrary to your existence.

This is the same mindset of persons who have severe medical symptoms but won't go to the doctor, or an abused spouse who believes their abuser didn't really mean to abuse them.

"Yep, I noticed something was amiss in the early 90's with the education system in California. I'm originally from Texas and we had wonderful public schools where I lived. Teachers wore pretty dresses to class. We used air-conditioned, double-decker, Greyhound busses for field trips to IMAX, the Houston zoo, museums, Sam Houston monument, and ice skating at the Galleria. In California, teachers wore sack dresses & Birkenstocks and took my son on a school bus to a ditch for a field trip. That was the last straw. Got back to Texas, and the schools were almost as bad. After also noticing the destruction of the family in the 70's & 80's, I knew something was up.

From there, schools & colleges continued to decline after being infiltrated by Socialist/Communist teachers who insisted on indoctrinating our kids with their agenda to insure future Liberal voters. Mothers were forced to work outside the home to keep the family afloat financially instead of nurturing the family in the home. Wages remained stagnant. Liberals infiltrated higher forms of government and attacked citizens through the IRS & spied on them through the CIA. They used the FBI, CIA, DOJ, and State Dept to try and remove our duly-elected & beloved, President Trump. They took over the MSM & social media, and attacked Conservatives while yapping on about *unity*. This was in spite of their rioting & attacks on Americans through Antifa & BLM.

Now we have a real mess to clean up, but the majority of that work should fall on the shoulders of the politicians of the Republican party. They were in a position to know who & what the Libs were doing. They worked with them everyday. They saw what issues they were voting on and how they voted.

Also, if there is one thing that I'm looking forward to about Trump not being president anymore, it's the fact that leftist won't be able to use the whole ""He's the president, so it's different"" argument. I've seen leftists frequently use that argument when people point out that Trump is living in their heads rent-free.

The supreme leader of Iran still has his Twitter after calling for the destruction of Israel. He’s about to hang a pro wrestler for protesting. He’s a literal terrorist.

Let’s just be honest here. Twitter has no goal of applying their ToS to people fairly. We know this when Antifa was allowed to openly schedule their events on Twitter this summer. Twitter is just another branch of the media pushing the narrative. Before you ignorantly blurt out that Twitter is a private company please realize that the government has a strong hand over them. Not only does the government use social media to spy on people, they also keep them in check through use of the court system.

"This is how you kill social media. You LEAVE

A social networks value, net worth, stock price, and influence are directly proportional to the number of users it has. When you delete your account, the company dies a little bit more. 


Rush had it right. You want to fight Twitter and Facebook, delete your account, and tell all your followers to delete their accounts.


Remember these companies depend on the user engagement hating other people generates. If all the conservatives left, the liberals would have no one left to hate, which would result in 2 outcomes: 


1 - The slowly drift off the platform due to boredom

2 - (Much more likely) they turn their hate into a circular firing squad and cancel each other out of existence. 


Either way, with the userbase decimated, the companies stock price plummet, and activist investors for hedge funds and big Wall St firms start lining up lawsuits citing the dereliction of fiduciary duty to the shareholders, they take over the board, they out the CEO and start replacing the activists in the company with normal people.

"If only conservatives could break their addiction to brands and convenience then real change could be achieved. Blogs, posts, writings, protests even riots are not effective. You want Big Tech, Corporations and politicians to take notice then we have to significantly impact their economic power. But it will hurt our sense of fairness, our sense of free market, our sense of charity. 
(1) Stop spending at chain businesses unless absolutely necessary (shop at small grocery stores) 
(2) Stop donating to charities. The vast majority of charitable giving is done by conservatives. Force the Red Cross to be the Christian charity it started out.
(3) No more high priced coffees, dinners out or movies. Starbucks, Dunkin Donuts etc all heavy supporters of DNC remove our business cost them every penny they donate to leftist organizations.
(4) Do not volunteer or support PTA or other volunteer organizations at schools. The school system is turning your children against you and your ideals.
(5) Stop tithes at churches, sounds counter to our values but churches were the center of the American Revolution now the hide behind their 501c force them to rejoin the fight. Stop tithes and tell them why. For Christ’s sake we have a communist Pope right now.
(6) This is the big one, stop using National/International banking conglomerates. Move your money to smaller regional banks, they won’t have all the bells and whistles but will keep your money local.
(7) If/When they pass the $2000 payments put it in your new banks savings accounts and only use it for real bills and expenses. The DNC is using these payments as an artificial means to prop up an economy that is going to collapse based on lockdowns and their published policy changes.
(8) Drop you phone plans with the big companies switch to conservative based service providers. 
This won’t happen because modern America will only fight for and advocate for any sort of action only if it doesn’t inconvenience or impact their lives. The left knows this and it’s why they keep winning. It’s why their will be no civil war or a real coup-d’etat. Get off social media and militarize your wallets.",Conservative

I personally haven’t shopped there since and I’m sure others of you haven’t as well but their stocks keep rising and look like a decent investment.

Watch their live streams: https://capitol-hill-riots.s3.us-east-1.wasabisys.com/directory.html

It’s become pretty clear that “illegal” is a dog whistle, it doesn’t really mean that the votes were illegal, it means they thought many of the people who voted shouldn’t have been able to.  With a layer of conspiracy theory on top.  https://youtu.be/ht20eDYmLXU?t=2739 Paxton says the quiet part out loud, he admits that because they were able to restrict who voted Trump won.  And then he says that their lawsuit was to try to impose that same standard on every other state.  “Illegal” isn’t about who voted legitimately. It’s about who *gets* to vote.

As I see it, these people rioted are the capitol because they either believe that many people shouldn’t have been able to vote during this election, or that they believe there’s a conspiracy so they don’t have to confront any ugly feelings about wanting to deny their fellow Americans their right to vote.

There also seems to be a big difference between what Trump /Conspiracy theorists say and right wing politics too.

Finally no one else is treating there corona virus as political either, everyone is working together to try and do their best. Obviously people are critical of their responses (particularly in the UK) but it is more to do with frequency of lockdown or permitted activities, rather than anything to do with the parties themselves.

The Twitter (and Parler) stuff seems to be more about terms of service violations rather than somehow a judgement on human rights history. It shouldn't be that hard to stay within the ToS and take reasonable corrective measures when violations are highlighted.

This doesn't contradict what he said though.

I'm also not from the US and our news (Germany) focussed a lot on Trump as well simply because the US is an important country to pay attention to since politics there will have implications for the rest of the world.

But all the protests and riots that have been going on over the past year or so are still, as /u/spark81z said, mostly seen as US-internal conflicts. Mostly because we simply do not really have the same issues over here in Germany.  
For example our political discourse is not nearly as partisan as in the US because we have many different political parties that are represented in parliament. Having 6 parties that represent different views and concerns of citizens is a lot less prone to that insane left-right divide we see in the US.

And the BLM protests are obviously seen as a (mostly) US-internal thing for historical reasons.

The Chinese Embassy justified the genocide being committed against the Uyghur people. All on twitter. All without repercussions. Denying service for breaking terms of use is one thing. Denying service to some for breaking terms of service while allowing other political factions twitter happens to agree with to break the law on their platform and break terms of service while enjoying liability protection as a platform is another. Not to mention many conservatives were purged without breaking terms of service. There are unwritten rules on social media platforms that only apply against conservatives, and liberals are free to routinely break terms of service as long as it fits the narrative the social media companies like.

You say that communists and bad world leaders supporting Trump here proves he is bad, but the bad world leaders you are referring to AREN’T supporting Trump here, they are arguing AGAINST Twitter banning government officials.

And I find it ironic you are so happy to use the morals of other world leaders to denounce Trump, but fail to see that everything the Democratic party stands for is entirely supported by every evil government to ever exist. Socialism: Lenin, Stalin, Mao. Gun control: Hitler. The list goes on and on. The entire democrat platform is advocated by complete despot world leaders.

Also, conservatism has nothing to do with supporting the government no matter what it does. That is called being a blind idiot. “There is no reason to burn Federal and State to the ground”? I’m sorry, but have you seen a single news story about the government for the last 50 years? I’m frankly shocked it took THIS long for Americans to storm the capital. This presidency did not inspire treason, and why you think that baffles me. The riots over the summer, the Republican party and Fox turning on its supporters, the complete and total disregard for the American people when considering Covid relief. The capital should have burned 3-4 times by this point. 

And again, if you are advocating that tech companies betray the principle of free speech, I ask you this: If Twitter is going to curate the content allowed on their site, how does this make them a free platform and not a publisher? And if they are going to allow some ideas and not others, then they should be held liable for the ideas they endorse. AOC, Cuomo, and Kappernick calling for more riots and Twitter endorsing it (especially financially with Kappernick)? Then they should be brought to court and sued as they are liable for the criminal acts that just took place.

They can agree to send billions of dollars overseas but not to help their own people, all while strangling small businesses and the income of millions of Americans with Covid regulations that do nothing but funnel money into the hands of the largest corporations in America while small businesses die by the day. 

I hate to say it, friend, but your vote is worthless. They do not care about you, nor have they ever. You will never see things improve because you give them no reason to improve.

At what point does the combination of extensive partisan censorship, liability protections for a claimed platform clearly acting as a publisher, and collusive oligopolistic behavior preventing other platforms from existing constitute some regulation or at least stripping of ridiculous liability protections? If this was all happening to the left’s ideologies, there would undoubtedly be calls for extreme intervention.",Conservative
"Nice try, but nope. That was twitter’s justification as far as what rules they claimed Trump and other conservatives broke, not mine. And yet they don’t enforce *their own* rules equally across all users, not even to the most extreme examples of authoritarian regimes calling for and justifying genocide. These are the very most extreme examples and even in those cases, twitter isn’t enforcing their own rules while “enforcing” their rules against American conservatives. That certainly isn’t a comparison between the US and Iran/CCP, but you clearly deliberately misinterpreted what I said in bad faith.",Conservative

"In regards to your votes worth: From a software developers perspective we tend sometimes to see people use apps in a different way because we didn’t give them a way to accomplish what they desire. I think fundamentally the issue resides in that we have to elect officials that may serve 1/2, 1/4, etc. of our desires rather than our ideas themselves being presented then direct voting. IE in some ways it would almost be better to elect ideas rather than individuals in some ways. I feel as though because we don’t have a way to do that in our system now, of course people are angry and feel the vote holds no value: it’s not tangible.

Furthermore if I wanted to see where my money actually goes, assess the books and cash flow to make an educated decision on anything, the systems in our country do not come in a modern format on which for me to search with ease. I can run advanced formulas over fantasy football yet cannot interactively analyze online spending for the local town. Maybe I’ll build an app and propose it as a contractor to local government. Statements the people, and not their ideas, make are not documented by the institution itself to establish credibility for career politicians.

"Mmm, I agree with you on a lot of what you said there. We absolutely need more modern ways to track a particular politician/local governance to assess their actual leadership. Furthermore, I love the idea of voting more on ideas rather than people. The trouble is getting the corrupt people in government to actually follow the ideas people want. 

As for actually showing where the money goes... that’s a double-edged sword. Sure, I agree that we need it, but the fact of the matter is that the people currently are already very angry about the spending exposed by the covid relief bill. If you were to show the current American populace where their money is going constantly, especially right now, that anger would only escalate to rage with a fair amount of the population. 

I wish there was a way for the people to hold their government to account in a much more direct way, without the need for empassioned and angry uprising, but the reality I fear is that anger and hate are the only motivations strong enough to make the American people get off their asses and do something about this blantant failing of the government on every level.

And really I’m not even arguing for intervention so much as reform of section 230 protections to account for when public platforms act more as publishers than platforms and prevent them from enjoying liability protection while acting as a publisher and potentially giving them the opportunity to regain said protections if in the future they decide they want to behave as a platform rather than a publisher.",Conservative
"Again, nice try. I would have no issue with their inconsistent application of their own rules *if* they didn’t enjoy the liability protections of a public platform. Maybe you’re not familiar with section 230?

Do you see no issue with their classification as a public platform that affords them liability protection while they clearly act as a publisher curating content according to ideology?

It's the same argument as to why you can't just get rid of social services (food stamps, for example) overnight. You have to wend people off of an addiction or it can have adverse effects.

When I lost my job I was able to receive payments which supplemented me while I searched for a new job, without said payments I don’t know where I would be.

I don’t know about you but my experience with big bad socialism is that it can bring serious benefits to a society, just as a strong capitalist element can.

Sure, maybe your country has a few social benefits, but those benefits invariably come off the back of the capitalist nature of your markets, as well as off the backs of the American system as well. As you should know, the vast majority of new medical treatments origininate from our system due to the ability to actually monatize the production of such treatments. Government subsidies are never enough to fund the research necessary, and without the ability to recoup their costs, such treatments would never exist. 

And that isn’t even to speak of how generally more advanced the healthcare in America is than its European or Canadian counterparts. 

Now, is healthcare more expensive than it should be? Yes. But a lot of that originates from how broken Congress is, fundamentally. Hence why the Congress desperately needs term limits and a completely new set of people in it.",Conservative
"They threw their support behind the rioters, not the general sentiment. AOC herself directly advocated for the rioting, making her the worst example of them all.

"You’re really twisting yourself into a pretzel here, and it’s hilarious. Public platforms don’t get to have their cake and eat it too. They don’t get to act as publishers curating content with an ideological slant while not being liable for the content they do allow. I’m not arguing for the outright removal of section 230 protections. I’m arguing that if they’re going to curate their content inconsistently to support a political ideology and shape public opinion, that they should be held liable for the content they do allow *OR* if they decide to enforce their rules to ALL users, ie act as a platform rather than a publisher, they can continue to enjoy liability protections. You’re clearly misunderstanding that what you said about Fox isn’t an exception, it’s literally what defines them as a publisher, the fact that they entirely control what content is and isn’t put forward, just like Twitter has done with conservatives and liberals, deciding that some political ideologues are free to break their own rules willy nilly while others can be removed without breaking rules. Either they’re a publisher that curates their content without needing to use rules to justify their curation, or they’re a platform that enforces their rules equally to all users.",Conservative

Because it is too busy paying for your’s.

Arguably, if America stopped funding these things, they could easily afford more social systems like you have... but the problem is that you would have to find funding for your own defense more than relying on the multinational ones as much.

I’m generally quite libertarian, but the law as it is isn’t being enforced against big tech firms. They’re certainly in violation of the Sherman Act over what’s happened with Parler over the last few days while enjoying overarching liability protection. You’re also conveniently forgetting to address that Twitter isn’t just allowing some members to break the rules, but they’re also allowing some users to break the law with incitement of violence/calls for the elimination of a certain Jewish country your party seems to take so much issue with (the Ayatollah being the one allowed to break these rules and incite violence on the platform without removal in this specific example). Your party is constantly trying to restrict free speech unless it benefits you. Can’t yell fire in a crowded theater right?

Why wasn’t any of this shit being done in all the BLM/Antifa riots in all of 2020 instead of treating them with kid gloves, making excuses for their riots, letting them burn down cities, cause Billions in damage, burn police precincts down while the cops are ordered to abandon it, they tried to burn down a police station with cops inside. Attacking a federal courthouse nightly for over a month. Taking over downtown in a major US city for over a month and declaring it not a part of the US? Where they had roaming armed guards??

I think it’s to rationalize their animosity. They know conservatives aren’t Nazis especially the top ones the elite/rich Democrats and party insiders. They’ve grown more and more vitriolic and it has to be rationalized somehow you can’t be this blatantly hypocritical unless you establish a foundation of justification.

Every online service does this. They store it as deleted. This is why you simply have to be careful about what you post in the first place.,Conservative
"Others do this as well.  Part of it is because you don't want to accidentally delete things that weren't supposed to be.  I can tell you this definitely happens in live environments.
    
The main concern here is that the data was able to be accessed and how easily it seems to have been done.",Conservative

"Fascism: a political philosophy, movement, or regime (such as that of the Fascisti) that exalts nation and often race above the individual and that stands for a centralized autocratic government headed by a dictatorial leader, severe economic and social regimentation, and forcible suppression of opposition.

"I watched the beginning of the 60 Minutes interview last night, and while I vehemently disagree with the violence at the Capital, she made it sound so harrowing, yet the worst she could point out was a broken mirror and selfies with shoes on her desk.  

Current politicians seem to have forgotten the founding fathers' concept of ""consent of the governed.""  Politicians think they are infallible, and demonize any protestors.  Both sides do it.  Anti-lockdown protests, protesting closed meetings that should be open to the public, protesting for justice, wanting election transparency...  If enough people have had enough of your policies that they're in the streets, on the steps of government buildings *protesting*, then as politicians they need to reevaluate their policies.

I watched the Wisconsin and Georgia hearings.  I think when you take Trump out of it and just listen to poll workers, it's clear there are errors processing ballots.  Why the hell is this such a dramatic, politicized thing?  Just because they're afraid some results might get reversed.

As for the presidency, that's tricky because you generally don't have the kind of clout to have a shot at the White House until you're older, hence why the youngest president ever was still JFK.

Signing a petition that literally does nothing = violently storming the US Capitol. 

This is extremely simple.  Both are acts related to try to overturn an election, yes.

So sure, they exist on the same spectrum, but benchmark them for the love of god.  Put them on a scale.  Signing a meaningless petition would be maybe score a 1/10 on the “let’s overturn the election” scale.” Violently attacking DC would be a 10/10.

The real issue is that Trump and many Republicans kept up a charade that somehow Congress was going to override the electoral votes and award Trump the Presidency. This is what led to the insurrection at the Capitol. 

All this because they couldn’t document any real cases of fraud and lost 59 court cases trying to change the outcome. In fact, the only valid arguments that they had in the end where that in some states like Pennsylvania election parameters were changed by someone outside of the legislature. Nefarious things like allowing extra days for ballots to arrive do to the problems at USPS.

Yes, it is true that the Democrats have contested electoral college votes, but as far as I know, in each of those cases the Democratic candidate had already conceded the election and there was no effort to change the results.

Trump also claimed voter fraud in the 2016 election that he won because his ego couldn’t comprehend that he had lost the popular vote. There was a committee led by Republicans that claimed to find fraud but [could not provide any data to back it up. ](https://apnews.com/article/f5f6a73b2af546ee97816bb35e82c18d)",Conservative

It's not hard to point out hypocrisy when you get to cherry pick the best version of an argument out of a massive group of people. News flash, that strategy literally always works with large groups of people. Dems, Republicans, rich, poor, etc. That's not a good argument, that's a strawman. 

This sub is filled with stuff like:
""Wow libs advocate for x but hate y, how do they not see the hypocrisy?""

When you get to make their argument for them, that argument will always look stupid. 

If literally half the country disagrees with you, they have some ground to stand on, acting like they don't is what makes our current political situation worse.

I call this new party America first instead of just ""Trump supporters."" because I believe while Trump instigated this split it will also live and grow beyond them.

You can see some republican politicians already courting their vote. Guys like Ted Cruz. I don't agree with conservatives on a fundamental level but to lump them in with this massive group of lunatics I call The America First party would be wrong imo.

That's the rub for the Republican party. Their voting base has effectively been cut in half. So what do you do? Do you distance yourself from the lunatic conspiracy theorists who just attempted a coup and lose their vote or do you stand with them and lose the vote of every day conservatives who absolutely do not stand with the crazies? The problem is they're not a fringe group of people who's vote is pretty irrelevant. It's tens of millions of people and growing.

"There’s actually many possible reasons for that. If they thought trump would be a valuable ally in 2016 but by election season 2020 it turned out he didn’t advance Putin’s causes as much as was expected (which he certainly didn’t), then the Russians would be less apt to interference and ad posting. Likewise is the idea that Putin is a fairly raging misogynist and that his hatred of Hillary specifically led to a lot of interference and her lack of presence turned him away from American politics. He may just have not seen a need or was expecting results favorable


Edit: for everyone saying the Russia stuff was fake, it’s true there was no collusion between the trump team and Russia, but that doesn’t mean Russia didn’t try to influence the election in certain ways. They did try micro targeting propaganda efforts at specific counties and areas that would shape the electoral election, but the results of that are very inconclusive",Conservative
"Do you really think Russia's goal was to get Trump elected? Their goal was to weaken the US by sowing division (among the domestic population and between America and her allies) and fomenting chaos. Trump was merely the opportunity that came along for them to do that.

"You realize theyve had Russian trolls on basically every platform advocating for Trump, right? They've been doing that crap for 6 years. Social media has actively had to moderate it. They've literally slipped up and released locations on posts, from Russia. Most of them can't even form complete sentences, but neither can a vast amount of Trump supporters, as it's hard to tell the difference at times. Someone with broken English, posting from Russia about support for Trump and hate for the left... you don't think? Hmm. People within the program have had interviews about it. Every counter intelligence division we have has confirmed it. They have massive govt sanctioned operations to disrupt foreign politics. Not just ours, but several other nations as well. They've hacked into nuclear sites. They are generally just causing chaos. And its working, obviously. A bunch of dumbfucks just stormed our own nation's capitol. You don't, for a second, think that they had a hand in encouraging people to go ape shit? If you don't, you are incredibly naive. Using Trump and his oddly dedicated base is the best way to cause chaos here, all they need is to poke at people's misplaced hate.",Conservative
"'Russia aiding the Trump campaign' and 'Trump colluding with Russia' are two entirely different claims. One is true with verifiable evidence and the other was an unfortunate conspiracy theory being peddles by Rachel Maddow et al. It's known that pro-Trump bots were created by several organizations (One of which was the Kremlin) to spew pro-Trump language and even organize Trump & Back the Blue events accross the US. 




Just my opinion: It's not hard to see these bots conspicuously posting auto-generated crudely-written content on Twitter; they look like textbook neural network (GAN) English - content that's pretty simple, vague and not very meaningful or related to what it's replying to. For example, on a tweet discussing, say, Big Tech, you'll ser a reply saying, ""President Donald J. Trump is the best president of my life time 🇺🇲🇺🇲🇺🇲. #MAGA #KAG for Four More Years."" These types of random unrelated replies are the ones i suspect of being bots but thats just speculation.

If what happened last week is domestic terrorism then so were the BLM and Antifa riots of 2020.  Violence and intimidation to achieve a political goal.

She didn’t tell Biden as Vice President to basically ignore all this voting stuff and just announce that she is president.

Imagine how completely insane the right would have gone if she tried that. That is what is happening right now except the shoe is on the other foot",Conservative

Nobody said this, certainly not on that petition. Trump won the election in the correct process, the supporters of that petition are merely calling on the electors to prevent it as they believed him to be dangerous to the Republic, and the democratic process provides a safety to avoid this. 


Trumpers on the other hand, genuinely somehow believe that the election was rigged.

I agree that many were changed unconstitutionally but a) We are in a pandemic, we can't act like these states just made changes for no reason and its all business as usual and b) I think Trump's point would have been far stronger if he made the point about literally every state that made changes to their election laws this way instead of the ones that he needed to win.

The Trump administration completely gutted our foreign services, has been difficult to negotiate with as a foreign power, and our allies see people marching on the capitol and wonder how much we can be relied upon.

Second that isn't the conclusion to be drawn there. Early on that appeared to be the case, yet we found out the Russians *tried* and failed to hack the RNC. We learned that the Steel Dossier was predominantly made up of Russian misinformation directly from Russian intelligence. As in what the left and the FBI did was play as useful idiots for Russian Intelligence.

If the election was deemed illegitimate, and Congress did not come to a conclusion as to what to do in the coming months (considering they can't agree on anything, that's likely), the presidency would go down the line if succession.

Imagine she told Vice President Biden at the time to make her president despite losing the vote.

Imagine Clinton, after being rebuffed called Biden a traitor because he was following the constitution. 

Imagine she gathered thousands of followers and pointed them at the capitol, telling them to go and change the mind of congress. To fight.

Imagine 5 people died that day.

Instead, what you got was concession, President Trump and investigations where evidence was presented after the fact.

Those rioters didn’t march with signs that said “Hang Joe Biden” for certifying the results of Trump’s victory. They didn’t bust into the Capitol, tearing down American flags. They didn’t march with the flags of the confederacy or Nazi parties. They didn’t destroy historic property or beat Capitol police. 

And while they were (not) doing that, Hilary didn’t tell them she loved them and call them special.

"Yeah the difference is hillary (who i do not like) didnt start a tirade of unsubstantiated claims and conspiracy theories for months to provoke the rioters, also there's a huge difference between a petition and storming the capitol, i suppose you think if it was done before then its ok for trump to repeat it now because others done it 4 years ago or 8 years ago or even 100 years ago.

I don't understand this way of thinking if someone done something bad years ago that really pissed you off would it not be better to not repeat the same mistakes and justify it by saying oh well they done it first.

Which people did, through peaceful means. The March For Our Lives. comes to mind. But the establishment didn't budge. Even Colin Kaepernick taking a knee was dismissed as a bridge too far. So a lot of people felt, rightly or wrongly, that they had no choice but to break stuff.

Compare that to what happened at the Capitol: Trump supporters wanted Trump to remain in office. They got a chance to vote. There was a concerted effort to get them registered, and help them vote.

They didn't trust the results, so they demanded a recount. They got a recount. Sometimes several.

They raised questions about ballot fraud and irregularities. So they filed suit. These suits were heard in court, with evidence presented from all sides. That didn't work out. They appealed. Even if not all appeals were heard, at least all were taken seriously.

And then, when everything else failed, they turned to violence.

Also: comparing a petition to a months-long effort, PLUS a violent attack, to overturn a free and fair election is absolutely a false equivalency. In the one week following the 2016 election, people protested peacefully through marches and signed petitions. Yes, people tried to call for the electors to change their votes, but that gained no traction and ultimately the 2016 votes were certified. And then those people moved on with their damn lives.

IMO, it’s demoralizing to the police that actually want to do a good job.  To hear “f the police” if I were an officer that tried to be a 100% moral and ethical upholder of the law - it’s disheartening. We need to quit vilifying all law enforcement.

Him telling his supporters he loved them is literally what anyone who isn’t a sociopath would do, he told them not to mess with USCP and they did it anyway so his word was useless.

There is precedent of people trying to seize control of the Capitol, the Capitol has literally been burned to the ground before. Not to mention, halting the certification of the electoral count would cause a 24 hour delay at the maximum. This entire process is almost always just a massive rubber stamp. 

By overdramatizing this situation and ignoring the real issue here, which by the way **is the well-being of others, not some bureaucratic ceremony** you are just drawing attention away from the fact that this nation has serious wounds.

The general ignorance of these procedures think that some trumpers are gonna get in the way of putting their man in office, because that’s all they care about. It’s not about the fact people died, If it was then we’d be up in arms a lot more about these things. You can draw some dots to clearly connect that—regardless of how much they deny it—people are only so hot and bothered about this because they think their man Biden won’t get put into office, and it’s just disgusting.

You think the (Democrat only) party, the states’ voting regulatory bodies, and the county, state and federal courts all are in on a conspiracy?  These same institutions that verified Trump just four years ago and many Senate and Congressional elections since then, are now somehow not just broken, but actively working together to fix the election?

"You’re not being high horsed. You’re being called out for a false equivalence.

For starters, these insurrectionists were engaged in insurrection because their preferred candidate lost an election and were organized and motivated by the leader of the GOP and several prominent members, one of whom denied the request to bring additional security to the situation.

This is completely different from protesting the continued lack of consequences for murdering a black person, which is not started or motivated by the Democratic Party nor is it related to overturning the constitutionally mandated transition of power. 

You may be choosing to ignore this, but you can hear people engaged in violent breaking talking about finding members of Congress and the VP on the many videos and having constructed gallows outside. And that you have to go back to the war of 1812 for the last time the Capitol was attacked tells us everything we need to know about the validity of your comparisons.

Also, while it is indisputable that numerous LEOs (and any is too many) were injured in the various George Floyd protests across the nation and over the year, the claim that ‘60’ were injured in the case you link to is dubious; there’s a reason all the links when you search for it are Fox News; it’s because there’s very little confirmation from official sources for this.

In the Capitol case, the CP have released an injury report and at least one was beaten to death, again by people rioting in support of a specific political candidate. The reason we have elections is so that we don’t use bullets, but apparently that’s the fallback for this crowd.  In comparison, you have cases of the instigators of the BLM protests (many of which were violently hijacked by extremists) protecting the police.

And the fact that it might have only delayed certification by 24 hours is beside the point. Had these guys actually captured and done what they were talking about to Congress  (and the VP) we’d be in a whole different place.

And I’m not even getting into the disparity of the number of arrests between the two, which clearly demonstrates the issue the Floyd protests were aimed at bringing attention to.

So in one case we have protests against a real problem that turned violent. In the other we have an attempted overthrow of the democratic system that elects the republic’s leaders that can only start with plans of violence, no matter how aimlessly executed it ended up being.

"Hi, Georgian here. Can provide some context to that shift.

The ~1,500 shift in the GA margin was due primarily to errors in one county: https://www.ajc.com/politics/election/floyd-county-fires-elections-chief/ZQYBXSX66JCKVB3DFOG4HHSBGQ

Essentially, Floyd County failed to initially count ~2,600 votes until the audit discovered them. Floyd is a rural county and had about ~41K total votes, so that's a big error, relatively speaking. The county elections chief for Floyd County was fired as a result, especially because they also had issues just 6 months earlier during the primaries.

Floyd went ~70% for Trump, so if the omitted ballots were consistent, you'd expect about 1,800 votes for Trump and about 800 for Biden, a net shift of about 1,000 in Trump's favor.

So you have about 1k shift from just 1 county with 41k votes, and the remaining ~500 from every other county combined (4.95 million votes). In other words, other than these omitted votes, there was only relatively small margins of error.

Additionally, I'm not sure about statewide, but Cobb County at least did an absentee/signature audit: https://www.ajc.com/politics/no-fraud-georgia-audit-confirms-authenticity-of-absentee-ballots/QF2PTOGHLNDLNDJEWBU56WEQHM/

">	Trump never said to overthrow democracy violently

Highlights from Trump’s [rally speech](https://www.rev.com/blog/transcripts/donald-trump-speech-save-america-rally-transcript-january-6/amp):

“All of us here today do not want to see our election victory stolen by emboldened radical left Democrats, which is what they’re doing and stolen by the fake news media. That’s what they’ve done and what they’re doing. We will never give up”

“There’s never been anything like this. We will not let them silence your voices. We’re not going to let it happen. Not going to let it happen.”

“States want to revote. The States got defrauded. They were given false information. They voted on it. Now they want to recertify. They want it back. All Vice-President Pence has to do is send it back to the States to recertify, and we become president, and you are the happiest people.”

“We’re going to have to fight much harder and Mike Pence is going to have to come through for us.”

“Now it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy. After this, we’re going to walk down and I’ll be there with you. We’re going to walk down. We’re going to walk down any one you want, but I think right here. We’re going walk down to the Capitol, and we’re going to cheer on our brave senators, and congressmen and women. We’re probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.”

“I spoke to David Perdue, what a great person, and Kelly Loeffler, two great people, but it was a setup. And I said, “We have no back line anymore.” The only back line, the only line of demarcation, the only line that we have is the veto of the president of the United States. So this is now what we’re doing, a far more important election than it was two days ago.”

“We’ve amassed overwhelming evidence about a fake election. This is the presidential election. Last night was a little bit better because of the fact that we had a lot of eyes watching one specific state, but they cheated like hell anyway.”

“Pennsylvania has now seen all of this. They didn’t know because it was so quick. They had a vote, they voted, but now they see all this stuff. It’s all come to light. Doesn’t happen that fast. And they want to re certify their votes. They want to re certify. But the only way that can happen is if Mike Pence agrees to send it back.”

“So today, in addition to challenging the certification of the election, I’m calling on Congress and the state legislatures to quickly pass sweeping election reforms, and you better do it before we have no country left. Today is not the end. It’s just the beginning.”

“So we’re going to, we’re going to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, I love Pennsylvania Avenue, and we’re going to the Capitol and we’re going to try and give… The Democrats are hopeless. They’re never voting for anything, not even one vote. But we’re going to try and give our Republicans, the weak ones, because the strong ones don’t need any of our help, we’re going to try and give them the kind of pride and boldness that they need to take back our country. So let’s walk down Pennsylvania Avenue. I want to thank you all. God bless you and God bless America. Thank you all for being here, this is incredible. Thank you very much. Thank you.”

The whole thing is just a mess of conspiracies hinging on a false claim that Mike Pence can and should overturn the election. Capped off with seditious incitement to march to the capitol and show strength, “because you’ll never take back our country with weakness. You have to show strength, and you have to be strong.”

Fucking yikes. That is not a thing a sitting president should be inciting. Much less anyone that calls themselves conservative.

>	I'm not trying to justify the event or any violence that may have taken place

What the fuck else are your apologetics supposed to be doing? You don’t get to have a weak opinion on sedition. Either you’re for that shit or against it. 

No amount of finger pointing or equivocations or conspiracy theories will make you right.

Again, I don't think there was any sedition. It was an unruly crowd that was literally allowed into the building by the security guards as can be seen from multiple videos. If you're gonna act like a couple broken windows and some cops that got beat up compare to the weeks of destruction that *was* literally being encouraged by democrat and corporate leaders then you are brainwashed. If blm were let into any buildings in dc they would have been torched to the ground as we have witnessed all summer",Conservative
"Interesting. My point about it being mostly (93%) peaceful still stands. I can assert that most people for BLM didn't want to riot, as evidenced by their actions, but I cannot assert the same about the quantity of people who rioted last week. I however can still assert that the results and base intentions speak for themselves:
The entire point of last weeks uproar was to raid the Capitol building, but that point was not similar with BLM for the vast majority of people. 
The people who did riot were admonished by everyone, democrats included. [Unfortunately there seem to be a lot of conservatives who approve of their riot](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-election-2020/republicans-congress-capitol-support-trump-b1783807.html)",Conservative
"No, I just think you aren't reading it. So I'll politely decline until you're done being a troll. Good day",Conservative
"and my point about leaders inciting violence without any serious repercussions or loud opposition from dems also stands

most of the people who went to the rally were peaceful. many many many of trump's rallies were peaceful and only escalated when lefties showed up to antagonize. the entire trump camping was run on ""law & order."" this is the broad brush painting i'm referring to.

it was intended to be a peaceful protest against certifying election results in a sham election. the intention was not to raid the Capitol. we could talk about how antifa has laid siege to government buildings for months and how that also is not as severely condemned by the same people who are loudly condemning the violence in DC",Conservative
"How far away from the topic do you intend to get? Far enough till you actually make a valid point it seems.

Is this loud enough for you? How many links do you want me to fetch before you're content that Democrats have acknowledged the problems BLM has had?

This is the issue with how you're equating things. You decided to compare last week's riot to the entirety of BLM (which consists of thousands of protests), and now you're trying to not judge the Captiol riots as a whole singular event but instead individual parts so you can assign blame accordingly. You can get as granular as you want and eventually this entire discussion will become meaningless, not to mention it's just another way to veer off topic.

The ultimate point of all of this is that in the specific context of unrest as a result of elections, democrats have not reacted the way republicans have, and the Republican reaction has been extreme and dangerous to democracy. There has been nothing quite this bad in this context.

If we decide to compare Democrat to Republican violence besides this context, we could broaden what we're talking about forever and ever and it would mean nothing anymore. Maybe that's actually what you want because it means not admitting what happened was wrong (without trying to deflect).",Conservative
"considering the violence committed up until this point by BLM there should be daily calls by lefties to disband the group. leaders have used incitedul rhetoric and have openly endorsed violence and looting. you really only see right wingers call BLM out on its actions, with lefties consistently dismissing it with the infamous phrase ""mostly peaceful protest."" lefties can't claim to want to unify while also looking away when BLM or antifa act up

i'm merely using the same rhetoric lefties have used for years to describe lefty violence, which is that the protest was mostly peaceful with a minority group of bad actors, which is true in this case. the difference is that almost all conservatives have openly and vigorously condemned what happened at the Capitol. the same cannot be said for the reactions, or lack thereof, of dem politicians over the past few years

i mean at one point antifa had actually taken over a city block in Seattle with weapons and were going door to door to charge protection fees. the mayor, who is a dem, called it all part of a ""summer of love."" now do you understand?",Conservative

What's sad is that key leadership from across the Democratic Party spent all summer publicly indulging, condoning and encouraging the violent rioting that took place across the country, yet not one raised a concern about how they might be indulging wackos.

"They've been saying ""The storm"" was imminent for the last 3 years.

To this day she simultaneously admits Q has gotten some things wrong while saying every prediction he has made has come true 100%. Her excuse is that sometimes he intentionally throws misinformation out there to throw off the deep state.

Her reasoning is just a mass of contradictions. There's no standard of evidence. She can't even say what Q's predictions mean until *after* they've come true. The sad thing is, her and I both grew up together as Jehovah's Witnesses, who use the same mental tricks as the Q movement. Believe me, Q is not new. Q is just a run-of-the-mill doomsday cult with a new wrapping. It takes advantage of two things: first, the desire for insignificant people to feel more important than they actually are, and second, the inability to face the fact that the world is just chaos and there's no secret cabal or invisible hand guiding the whole thing to some end.",Conservative

So the tl;dr is: A chemical company was dumping shit into the river, amd because of that the frogs in the local river literally turned gay. It was not intentional, just a strange result of neuro-biology reaction to a new chemical in its enviroment.

Alex Jones took this and ran with it. Turning it into an unhinged rant about how it was part of an experement where the elites were planning on feminizing western men with these chemicals ect...

"Trump got people because he was the only politician talking about the things that actually mattered to them in decades. Most people, if you got them in a room by themselves, don't *really* give that much of a fuck whether other people have abortions or whether we have this foreign policy or that foreign policy. Most people want a good, stable job that keeps a roof over their head, food on the table, and allows them to save up enough to have fun every once in a while. Anything beyond that, most people *really* don't care all that much. Trump hit them on the issues that affect what they care about. He straight up told them ""I am going to fight so you can have a good job, feed your family, and have some fun sometimes."" Did he deliver on that? Maybe. A lot of plants he visited claiming he was going to save all their jobs (Carrier in Indiana for one) ended up outsourcing and moving out of country anyway, but I'm sure someone could bring up some new plant that opened somewhere else and created jobs, so I don't really know. Point is, he talked about what people cared about. 

The GOP long ago rolled over on Globalization, trade agreements, etc. NAFTA was bipartisan. Ross Perot was the only Presidential candidate against it in '92. I grew up in rural Michigan. I saw *first-hand* what NAFTA did to our small towns. I'm old enough to remember booming small businesses on main street. The Electrolux plant in Greenville, Michigan employed 3,000 people in a town of less than 10,000. They left town and shuttered their doors for Juarez, Mexico, putting nearly 1/3rd of the town's population out of work all at once. You know what jobs came in place? Wal-Mart came in a few years later and hired about 500. That's it. Half of downtown closed. Want to know why people are demanding a $15/hour minimum wage? Because McDonalds and Wal-Mart are the only places left to work. They can't just go and get a factory job and make more. It's either be poor, or pay tens of thousands of dollars for a college education and still probably end up being poor, but in debt to boot. Our system is set up to where you are limited in your potential unless you're a doctor, lawyer, or engineer. That or if you start your own business, which typically carries heavy risks of its own and requires shit-tons of startup capital.

And not one Presidential candidate, Democrat or Republican, spoke out against it. Not until Trump came along. We have long memories in the rust belt and we never fully got over it. Trump is basically the Bernie Sanders of the right. Criticize Sanders all you want but he was the only Democrat talking about the skyrocketing costs of health care, housing, and, education. You may not agree with his solutions but he was the only one acknowledging them as problems in the first place.

I hope the GOP learns the lesson that you can have a candidate who cares about all the things Trump said he cares about without being a narcissistic psychopath. Trump shouldn't be the best you have to tackle these issues. And if Trump had just behaved himself better, he could have set the GOP up on this path and made them a force to be reckoned with. Instead, he's dividing the party on the way out and setting up the Democratic Party to have complete control for a generation. And *he doesn't care.* He really doesn't care which party has power, as long as it's him. He sees the GOP as betraying him and he wants to take them down regardless of the long-term consequences. Because Trump doesn't think long-term. Trump only thinks in terms of ""what will make me feel good right now?""",Conservative

"The Proud Boys allow members of other races in, but they are certainly tolerant and open to white supremacist beliefs.

They aren't white supremacist in the sense of what you're born as but more white supremacist in a cultural sense. They (well, most of them) don't care what color your skin is, but to be a member you *must* conform to ""white values,"" aka the Western European value system and lifestyle. It's not strictly racism as much as it is culturalism. Conform to, basically, 1950s values, or else. They accept non-white people who dress, speak, and act ""white,"" but not those who don't. Show me a Proud Boy who celebrates Kwanzaa and I'll admit I'm wrong, but somehow I doubt they're very supportive of the more ""ethnic"" behaviors and values. The racism isn't in ""my skin color is better than yours"" but more ""the culture people with my skin color created is inherently superior to the culture people with your skin color created.""

Perfect historical example: Cecil Rhodes. He didn't think black South Africans were inherently inferior to white people, but he felt their *culture* was. He despised tribal people being happy without having many possessions. He felt the ""Western"" ideal of working yourself to death so you can surround yourself with material wealth was inherently superior. It's no different than the US destroying the Native American tribal way of life because they felt it was ""savage."" But any study into the hunter-gatherer lifestyle proves it actually results in far less stress and greater satisfaction with life, as well as better health. There's a trade-off, though, because now that everybody is spending all their time working for their survival needs, there's no time to create or build anything beyond those needs. But ask anybody who's successfully lived the off-grid homestead lifestyle. The rat race is inherently worse for your overall well-being, but most of us are just unable to escape it, so we convince ourselves it's superior. Essentially it's the belief that ""life shouldn't be that easy.""",Conservative

I specifically remember when Nancy Pelosi first became Speaker of the House her stated goal was the make the Democrats like the Republicans in that regard.

Maybe he didn't actually intend that to happen. Knowing how a narcissists brain works, I doubt it. Just seeing how he conducts himself for the past 4 years, I believe he *loved* it and the speech condemning it afterwards was a deal he made with Pence not to 25th him right then and there. He put his VP and his family's life in danger for doing nothing but fulfilling his constitutional duty. Have a problem with the election results? Then maybe Trump's team should have actually claimed fraud in their lawsuits. They were claiming fraud in the months leading up to the election and were challenging the results in court for months after. They lost 60+ cases--many to judges Trump himself appointed--because Guiliani is a fucking embarrassment of a lawyer. And sure, maybe you can claim widespread government conspiracy even among all the justices Trump appointed. But even granting that, you have to then admit that if Trump really is trying to fight the deep state, he's really, really, really fucking *Bad* at it. How is appointing dozens of deep state judges, spending four years campaigning for deep state Republican congress members and Senators, and appointing three deep state Supreme Court Justices who have *lifetime appointments* that he nor any other President can remove supposed to be fighting this supposed deep state? I'm calling a spade a spade here. Trump is a simple-minded narcissist who only thinks in terms of what makes him feel good in the short term. It's the only way I can make sense of the last four years. I've dealt with these people all my life. Maybe I'm wrong, but I doubt it.

Trump has a history of using language irresponsibly, and then washing his hands of what some of his extremist followers do afterwards. There were people who showed up with zip ties. People who intended to do harm from the very start. They came there expecting a revolution and while Trump may not have explicitly told them ""go storm the capitol and execute congress,"" he certainly wasn't de-escalating or calling for calm on that stage, either. Trump came out later to condemn it but at that point it's like a drunk driver saying ""maybe I shouldn't have tried to drive"" after crashing the car.

For one, Frogs don't really have any differences in their ""plumbing."" Male frogs don't have a penis and female frogs don't have a vagina.

So it wouldn't take much hormonal changes to change how an amphibian works. It's actually a decent survival adaptation. If you suddenly found yourself in a population with way more males than females, then a bunch of those males could become female for the purpose of reproduction, or vice versa.

The problem is, when people rightly point out that we need to fix these extremes, other people want to take it too far, and say things like not wanting to have sex with a transgender person is a hate crime, or acknowledging that transwomen have inherent physical advantages to ciswomen that should disqualify them from competing in certain sports where that physical advantage is relevant is bigotry.

I tell you what, if I worked a physical job, I would be highly motivated to stay in better shape because it would make my daily life that much easier. You don't see fat guys in construction very often for a reason.

I think a better explanation than chemicals in our drinking water is the fact that we have more reasons not to exercise today than in the past. It was easy to be in shape 100 years ago because there were no TVs, computers, or phones to park your ass in front of. Back then, being fat meant you were rich, and you were actually considered more attractive for it. Throughout history, being a little ""thick"" was considered the ideal beauty standard. Hell, even today you go to a country like Cambodia and the women there will fawn all over you if you're a fat, white guy. In places like that it's an indication of wealth and stability. Being poor and fat is a very recent development in human history.",Conservative

Not necessarily. We have a very unusual situation in which calorie-rich foods are extremely cheap. Not to mention, everybody's metabolism is different and is somewhat malleable. Eating a 1500 cal/day diet will cause some people to lose weight and other people to gain. That's why exercise is an inextricable part of the picture. It is calories in/calories out but you have control over your calories out every bit as much as you have control over your calories in.",Conservative
Thanks. Sounds like it’s pretty spicy.,Conservative
"They may be calorie dense but they’re rather empty and eating out and eat fast food all the time is expensive because those foods aren’t protein rich so you eat more to feel full. And really liquid calories people don’t seem to count  and sugar is addictive. Processed foods aren’t the best. 

 It’s cheaper to make your own food and buy canned food or produce.

What they didn't like was Pres T coming in, and instead of rolling over and playing according to their rules as has been done previously, he wanted change and was willing to pack his stuff and leave.

The reason that everyone is having trouble with this one and being accused of cognitive dissonance is pretty simple actually; they're unable or not willing to connect the dots that these companies are clearcut monopolies. 

As a monopoly, any censorship is defacto anti-competitive and you don't even need to necessarily invoke free speech values. That said, I do think there is a very clear and consistent argument for the government regulating a monopolistic private takeover of what was once considered the 'public square'. A cartel that exerts monopoly control of the digital public square can and should be treated differently than businesses that are merely interacting with it. When you frame it this way, there is little similarity between facebook/twitter and a bakery shop. 'muh private company' is not the argument that some on the right & left thinks it is.

"Quotes from around the sub that are super relevant in this topic for sure - 

- Free speech isn’t, or shouldn’t be an “us versus them” thing. The principle of free speech is for everyone; their stance is on the side of free speech, not “ours” since it exists outside of our flavor of politics.

- This is direct cause of identity politics. When you define the world between good and bad, when you define yourself and all of your comrades as good, then when you have power, you can't do no wrong. If you sometimes see some of your fellows doing something that you don't understand, it just means that you are not good enough follower and have to work more to match their level of goodness.The unfortunate thing is that people who engage to this kind of thinking rarely fully wake up because they tie their identity so strongly to the cause.

- Good luck competing against Amazon, Microsoft, and Google for server space. Also Amazon’s servers account for more than half of the internet’s hosting.Companies are free to choose what they do but when you become bigger than the government in power and influence what does it mean now?

- They already started doing it to firearm companies. Cutting off their banking services. Operation Chokepoint. Also, banks have been targeting individual companies, closing their accounts and credit lines. PayPal refuses to do business with firearm companies. BoA has dropped firearm and firearm accessory manufacturers. The next logical step is to start doing this to conservatives. I’ve seen many people advocating ostracizing conservatives from commerce in the last several days - calling for people to fire conservatives, refuse to do business with them, etc. And they get tons of upvotes. Pretty scary sentiment. Cryptocurrencies are a viable alternative to traditional banking, but the problem is that the IRS decided that cryptocurrencies are capital assets, not currencies. So every time you exchange Bitcoin for a good or service, you have to record the fair market value of the Bitcoin you traded and calculate your net loss or gain since you purchased that Bitcoin. Which means that anyone forced into dealing exclusively in Bitcoin for payment is going to have an accounting nightmare.

- This is the scariest thing that has happened in the past week. AWS which hosts almost 50% of all internet websites, now has the public ""OK"" to just turn off whatever they don't want people to see on the internet.

- Ironically, Amazon hides behind Section 230 Protections to so they are only liable to pull down content that is illegal once it has been reported and verified.But Parler doing the same instead of using proprietary AI bot networks to conduct preemptive user surveillance and mine user data for use by the Tech Cartel - that is grounds for Amazon to kick them off. What garbage-tier human beings these are. This is obvious anti-competitive practice and collusion between Apple, Google, Amazon, Facebook, and Twitter. It's illegal and should be punished to the furthest extent of the law under the Sherman Anti-Trust Act. Corporatism is the bane of Capitalism and must not be tolerated.

- Google and Amazon control major DNSes, if they wanted to, they could block replication and effectively silence it for anyone using their services. Google is going to start blocking websites in Chrome in the next few years. Guarantee it. Apple will block websites in Safari as well.Pretty soon just accessing a normal website is going to be like to accessing a Tor darkweb site. You'll need to use a special web browser to do it.

- Even if they did that, they still need the public IP addresses and DNS registration to operate. Both in witch are controlled by ICANN. In witch Apple, Google, Amazon, and the Government can pressure ICANN to revoke the IP address and DNS names. Effectively killing parler.

- hey’re focusing on content and app providers now, but I bet that the next shoe to drop is that they will start to control users. It will be something like you void your warranty if you have apps or if you access content that isn’t approved by them because security risks potentially compromise your hardware or some bullshit like that. Not only will you void your warranty but you won’t have access to the App Store at all. Maybe they blacklist you and won’t even sell you a phone. If you don’t comply with their values, you don’t get to participate in modern technology.

- Twitter stock drops after they ban Trump and suddenly multiple megacorps simultaneously shut down their biggest competition. Collusion is illegal.

- Contact law relies that the terms be clear and objectively verifiable. Parler, AFAIK, relies on US Jurisdicational law to implement its moderation policy. Hence this is a clear and objective standard. So for AWS to say it is breach of their T&C, then they would need to show there is a failure on Parler's part to meet those standards. If not, then what is left is AWS one-sided and subjective interpretation of the contract and this is so one-sided (in terms of each parties power) then they voided the contract and so may be subject to damages to the business losses Parler suffered. Amazon's failure to give Parler a ""commercially reasonable"" period to cure is also somewhat suspect. Given they canceled them over a weekend with very little notice.

- Amazon can take the hit they are extremely diverse. I would not gamble against them, at least not betting for much more than a couple point drop.Facebook and Twitter are much more directly tied to just income streams from users, with Twitter being more vulnerable IMO. Do note that the effects of users ditching them could take a quarter or two to be realized on their balance sheets. I’d expect them to drop a little bit more this coming week, then rally back up for a while. If any serious drop comes it will likely be after or shortly before (if there’s leaks) an earnings report.",Conservative

"The Trump camp has had months to investigate election irregularities. They've been laughed out of court, including SCOTUS, literally dozens of times. Trump is going to claim he won the election no matter what the evidence says. That is clear. Every time he loses, he claims fraud. He accused Ted Cruz of fraud when he lost the Iowa Caucus.

Neither Trump, nor his most extreme supporters will ever accept anything other than the conclusion he won the election. No amount of investigation will *ever* be good enough. Even if they got their 10 days, and examined everything fairly and openly, and the conclusion still came back that Biden won the Presidency, Trump would not accept it. At this point, I have very little reason to believe a 10 day investigation would bring about anything ground-breaking beyond what's been brought up in the past few months. The idea that millions of votes were fraudulently cast is a very serious accusation, and the Trump administration again, has had months to present this evidence. Not only have they not presented any evidence (affadavits are not evidence), they *haven't even claimed voter fraud* in their court cases beyond a few hundred votes here or there. Sidney Powell even rebuffed Tucker Carlson's request for this evidence. Trump's own AG said there's no evidence of fraud to the level that would overturn the election.

These aren't all just liberal justices saying this, either. Many of these are judges Trump himself appointed, including three of the SCOTUS judges that rejected the Pennsylvania case. At this point, there are only two possibilities.

Either there is a vast conspiracy against Trump at all levels of government, and Trump is really, really, really, really *BAD* at fighting it (considering almost everybody he's ever hired or appointed is supposedly in on it), or Trump lost and his ego is too big to ever admit it. If I'm applying Occam's Razor, here, I'm leaning toward the second option. Even if I'm wrong, the fact that Trump has entrenched agents of the deep state *even more* into the highest levels of government out of sheer ineptitude is a black mark on his record.

At this point you have to ask yourself, is there any situation in which Trump would admit defeat? If not, it's really hard to see any requests for delays and continuances--especially since it would be unconstitutional at this point--as being made in any sort of good faith. It's clear there is only one conclusion the Trump administration will ever accept, and when only one conclusion is acceptable, no requests for investigation are made in good faith.",Conservative

As evidenced by this. How could you possibly even think this is an argument when none of those cases have been addressed on their merits. They've all been thrown out on standing, laches and the like. The SCOTUS decision wasn't an own on Trump, it was a travesty. How could a state not have standing when another state breaks their common contract (Constitution) by violating the electors clause?

One or two corrupt judges I'd accept. But 60+ cases being dismissed out of hand, by a number of Trump appointees no less? What am I supposed to think?

As for Trump judges, you should know by now that McConnell and Trump aren't exactly the best of friends, and it was McConnell and Federalist Society that provided the lists Trump picked from.

Just wanted to ask, is this *really* what we want? I think corporate control run amok is a disaster, but this kind of heavy-handed, blanket rule seems almost equally dystopian. Maybe im not smart enough to offer a perfect solution, but I would like to see something that more forces companies to be consistent and open about their moderation criteria, rather than throwing it out altogether. I've been around long enough to see what happens on the internet when there are absolutely no rules, and tbh, it's a really low-quality experience.  


Also, unrelated but I'll ask since I haven't been able to post here for a while....Do any of you guys think the Trump Twitter ban issue is a bit of a self-goal? The president could honestly call a press conference in 2 minutes and have half of the world tune in, but from the start he has bucked the tred by placing his main comm strategy in the hands of a private company, and honestly, while the banning itself and Twitters enforcement are worthy of criticism, the idea that the POTUS is deplatformed rings hollow in my ears.

One recent common sentiment I’ve seen really doesn’t make sense to me. So I’ll break it down and I’d love any more conservative voices to weigh in. 

I totally get that the right feels there is hypocrisy in the coverage of the capital coup/riot vs the BLM protest/riots. What I don’t get is the overall gravity of these things being directly equal. In my perspective I see comments that basically say “how can libs be so quiet when POcs who feel they are consistently murdered without a crime and then without justice for their killers, often in uniform burn down a Starbucks? 

Those on the left should really then not have a strong reaction when these trump supporters (a) stormed the capital at the direct suggestion of the sitting president due to fraud that no state has been able to back up (b) threw down the flag of our country and replaced it with that of a single politician (c) were allowed into the building by cops. 

I know this brings up several different prongs but if I saw an article tomorrow that said one political party in Iraq burned down a mall with no one in it because their tribe/social group/race was being murdered and another group got whipped up with no evidence into storming the capital, I wouldn’t see those as equal offenses or of equal validation/motivation.",Conservative

""Fine a social justice warrior"" that's also a bit of a mis-truth. They won't fine someone who promotes some social justice, they fine ANYONE who says anything that goes against government message but the government itself funds troll farms.

I dunno how much Poland fits with your values but if you hate elections they straight up cancelled their own elections and declared them unconstitutional.

They removed protections from ballots so you could just print one off at home and the police would legit have a hard time figuring out if its real or not.

A few short days before they were meant to have their elections they just straight up said that there were no candidates (there were) but then the elections were cancelled only 3 days later.

They created a civilian military within the ministry of defense and had generals answer to it. Full military generals answering to a 27yr old former pharmacy assistant with no higher education degree.

They made it illegal for judges to question the legionary of appointed people and skip over the questioning process before approval. They can also fire judges at will and extend the retirement age of judges that they 'deem worthy.

They took over state media and made it a propaganda tube. Sure people may say that about American media but theirs calls any protest a 'coup' and anyone who disagrees with the government is a 'paedophile defender', which funnily enough is something the government did and still does when it comes to their Catholic Church.

Tabloids cannot spam you with disinformation the way social media can, and people shouldn’t have to take everything they read online with the same level of skepticism that they take tabloids.

So subreddits like that, nazi subreddits etc. has been banned. Also others that they deem hateful or otherwise hurtful and I guess that is where the slippery slope is.

I think Parler or any other free speech community will need to figure out where that line is drawn because its users will be associated with the content as well and many don't want to use the same platform as jailbait-people or nazis.

You're overthinking this. When you get down to buying servers and parts, you don't need a crazy contract/licensing deal like you would with having a persistently hosted site with AWS or Microsoft's Azure platform. If they have the money, they could buy the stuff. You don't need to explain yourself when you buy servers, and they should source them from multiple places if they didn't want large orders turning people's heads.

That you're saying ""they need to support a lot of users, so they can't do this"" is very defeatist. They don't need to get up to full capacity right away. They could go so far as to turn the site invite-only and semi-private while they ramp up. They could start small in scale just to get things tested and running.

Getting that many servers within a month is absolutely doable, give it another two weeks for deployment and testing.

As for whether or not retailers will sell to them, just hire a contractor to do the work for you. Have DouglasTodd19 Computer Services buy the hardware, and not have to worry about the Parler name getting your orders canceled.

"> You're overthinking this. When you get down to buying servers and parts, you don't need a crazy contract/licensing deal like you would with having a persistently hosted site with AWS or Microsoft's Azure platform.

You would certainly need a contract to buy millions of dollars of hardware. 

> If they have the money, they could buy the stuff.

They apparently can't buy services from AWS or Azure.

> You don't need to explain yourself when you buy servers

As I said, a large B2B transaction like this would require a written contract. They may be able to create a corporation that Parler would own to get around this so the company they're buying from doesn't know who they are really selling the hardware too.

> That you're saying ""they need to support a lot of users, so they can't do this"" is very defeatist.

It's called being realistic. Why would I promote a plan that isn't going to work?

> They don't need to get up to full capacity right away. They could go so far as to turn the site invite-only and semi-private while they ramp up.

"Interesting that this sort of sick extremism, which was feared to occur as a result of President Trump making executive orders, etc., never occurred because of anything President Trump did.  The closest thing was this: https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/statement-press-secretary-010521/
But that early January statement did not qualify political rallies of another, opposing political party as somehow being ""domestic terrorism."" The actions and proposals of the Democratic Party would label opposing part(ies)' expressions as ""terrorism,"" creating a one party State, in violation of the First Amendment.

 Instead it was because of a combination of Republicans losing the Senate, Biden ""winning"" (I use that term loosely) the Presidency, and then (with this newfound power that the Dems realized, or knew they would have as of Jan. 20, 2021, to have control over House, Senate, and Presidency / Executive branch), plus their existing relationships with big tech (Twitter, Facebook, Amazon, Google), that this extremism occurred - this extreme censorship and new ""defining of terrorism,"" despite that the U.S. Supreme Court decisions and precedents protect political rallies as a form of First Amendment speech.

Of course, it won't be long before the Dems start threatening U.S. Supreme Court Justices anew and possibly bully them into ruling against First Amendment freedoms and in favor of defining specific political groups as ""domestic terrorists"" when we speak online or in person.  We've already seen Schumer expressly threaten U.S. Supreme Court Justices last year.  Since the Senate could very well go back to Republican control in November 2022, I don't think that will work out very well for Democrats who think that's a great long term strategy. More likely, it will result in fracturing of our internet and dissolution of platforms that couldn't survive the purges we are seeing now in 2021.

Where is the spirit that defeated the British against overwhelming odds? Where is the strength that defeated the democrat slavers during the civil war? How about that National Socialists? WW2 would have been lost without the Americans. There are things that can be done to fight this. For instance, truckers can refuse to deliver Amazon products until they stop playing politics. I don't know if it would work, but it can be tried. 

Being emotional thinkers and not logical ones (this is why the progressive left is perfectly fine with their hypocrisy surrounding the riots this summer and the riot at the capitol - they agreed with message of Antifa and BLM so it made them feel good while they disagreed with the message of Trump followers so that made them angry. Logic dictates that either you accept violent protests for all sides or you accept them for none. But logic has nothing to do with it. Their ""logic"" is determined by whether they agree with the message or not.) , progressive lefties need to be made to feel that what they are doing to stifle freedom in America is wrong. The only way that can happen, in my opinion is to use their tactics against them. Companies with conservative CEO's such as Qualcomm can make it be known that they will not do business with progressive left-wing companies the support the stifling of their ideological opponents.

At the state level, conservatives can pressure the state governments for a convention of states. Like minded red states can band together to fight the democrats at every step. 

At the local level, conservatives can pressure their school boards, their local governments etc, to expel progressive lefties who support the use of corporate power to hurt conservatives. Failing that, conservatives can run against progressive lefties at the local level.

"I didn't have an interest in it either, but my wife became interested in TLM and our Parish has been offering one for more than a decade, so we started attending.

I didn't like it; I felt it was very difficult to follow what was happening and it all felt very foreign from the Novus Ordo I was raised on.

During Low Mass you can't hear the Priest for much of it, and I'm going be honest and say that High Mass drags on too long because the choir sings so slowly.

I purchased one of these [Missals](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001V3QYUU/) and started following along. This goes on for a couple of months, and something happened where we couldn't attend the TLM, so we went to a normal Mass...I couldn't believe it...I disliked it so much!

To me Novus Ordo feels less reverent and the translations feel less impactful to me. It's really strange, it feels like they ""dumbed down"" a lot of the language to make it more modern.

If you haven't attended the TLM I'd recommend picking up a Missal and attending a few (there will be an adjustment period), and see what you think.

If you've been and you don't like it then that's fine too; I don't think TLM needs to be mandated and everything needs to be old-fashioned (like some Trads do).",Conservative

A lot of Trads will tell you to wear black if you're married or white if you're not.

"According to [this study ](https://doi.org/10.1146%2Fannurev.clinpsy.032408.153618) roughly 5% of the population is considered to be pedophilic. So if 4-5% of priests are pedophiles, that’s pretty consistent with the human average.

According to [this ](https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/saycrle.pdf) over 90% of victims of sexual abuse know their aggressor and over half of those aggressors are family members. You are many times more likely to be abused by your uncle or dad than by a priest.

The specific position, and celibacy is attractive to a certain group of men who have very deviant desires.  They have access to kids.  But here’s the kicker, thousands of complaints and allegations and the church for a very long time would shuffle priests into different positions and different geographic areas to avoid prosecution. The church became the coverup vehicle. And it’s a problem.",Conservative

As for the coverups, Yea dude that was wrong and fucked up. I definitely hate that they did that. The Church also waged a few wars we shouldn’t have. Fortunately I don’t let a segment of a group speak for a whole, and I don’t let moments in the history of an institution speak for the whole.

I will never forget my Junior year, I had to take a Latin Music course which I guess I had to take for credits towards my major. The professor was from Cuba originally and was in a Latin music group I guess. The class had to form groups and go to some salsa clubs and other Latin Music venues then write a group paper. There were 5 of us in the group and I was the only Caucasian. After the venue tour which I was the driver, we wrote the paper. All of us put our reports in the paper. I wrote about 5 pages and the others 2-3 pages. The professor had no idea who wrote what part. I thought we would get a group grade but we each got individual grades. The other 4 members received A's while I received a C-. Come to find out, other Caucasian members in the class received a C- too while non-Caucasians got A's. I complained to the higher ups about it but they just told me to let it go. That was 20 years ago. I would hate to see what professors do now with students with a conservative mindset.",Conservative

But I would like to point out that young voters came out in record numbers to vote in Georgia, and I'm sure some of them were inspired by the things they read on the internet, just as much by political leaders.  Change does not simply start at the top and trickle its way down.  It starts with the private conversations we have with friends and family.  The type of of things we joke about or the sentiment we express.  It works it's way up to the water cooler talks we have at work.  To the type of policies we put into place in the private and public sector.  To the memes we generate on the internet.  So when you say it does not matter, EVERYTHING matters, from the bottom up, to voting and marching in the streets.  We thought a bunch of crazies on the internet talking about lizard people does not matter, well apparently it matters a lot.

"The chamber has C-SPAN cameras, and there were a few hundred people in there before the Speaker was taken away. She wasn’t spilling a secret anyone else couldn’t have spilled. The Speaker’s use of that room during a session is not the least bit secret. It was shown on live TV just before the storming. So tweeting that location isn’t revealing a secret. And it doesn’t appear Boebert tweeted anything about where they took Pelosi after that point. Now THAT would’ve been a security breach. But tweeting that the Speaker is in her chair during a session is like tweeting that Santa Claus sits at the mall in December.

I get that this woman is a nut, and clearly sympathetic to violent protesters. But critics will need a stronger case than this to see her expelled or prosecuted.",democrats

Charge too little for sweaters? Also jail...",democrats

If the second tweet revealed Pelosi's location it would be a huge problem, but it didn't, it simply stated one location where she wasn't.

I have a major problem with the fact that she was assisting the insurgents at all. However, there simply isn't enough information here to know whether the second tweet was a criminal act. 

 I also have a major problem with her voting to overturn a fair election, but she was not alone in this.

I get that emotions are high, but I think that we need to be careful about jumping to conclusions too.",democrats
"People should also consider that this woman, like that nut from Georgia and at least a dozen of her House colleagues, WANTS this kind of attention. She wants you to hate her, pursue her, pick fights with her. That’s her entire reason for being in politics - to pick fights. She’s not there to make anyone’s life better but her own, and she will only achieve that goal if she becomes the full-time, Fox-sponsored “Liberal Target” she’s branded herself as. Don’t take her bait.

If she committed an offense, let justice be done. But don’t give her too much of your own attention.

Follow the example of House Democrats like John Lewis, Jim Cooper, Annie Kuster, Deb Haaland, etc. Those people see public service as a way to help others, to solve problems and build a better country.

"There needs to be some kind of emergency response that enables congress to remove a sitting President immediately in the event he or she commits crimes like this one did on Wednesday. The fact that he is still in office five days later is appalling, reckless, and scary. 

Relying on A VP to invoke the 25th is inadequate because the two were elected together. The Congress, and/or the Supreme Court (with a simple majority) should have the power to invoke the 25th just as well as the VP, because our government is composed of three coequal branches. And one branch should be able to stop any other branch in an emergency, even if only short-term, so an investigation can take place. 

Also, I understand that if a person commits a felony, and during the commission of that felony, a person dies, they can and should be held responsible and charged with manslaughter, if not murder.",democrats

Impeachment is decided by Congress.  We need to start respecting our system of government again; I believe that’s why Joe is strong on calling out Trump’s crimes for what they are but less willing to speak on a potential impeachment.,democrats

"Or his enablers, professional or civilian",democrats
I agree with Joe. Impeachment is weak tea and makes Democrats look ineffective as it's going no where with Republicans unlikely to support it in sufficient numbers. Trump needs to arrested and put in jail. Immediately removed. But it can't happen until after Trump is officially out.,democrats
Decisions here are going to put Joe Biden in Abe Lincoln's role or Andrew Johnson's role. One presiding over a Civil War and the other over Reconstruction.,democrats
"Right. He's president-elect. Not his role to demand any action from Congress or Pence. And it's not his job to direct his AG to investigate or prosecute anyone. I support the Democrats and Biden because I *don't* want to be the party where the leaders chant ""lock him up!""",democrats

Right now some private companies out of many are choosing to censor conservatives the FTC can punish and fine those companies if they choose but conservatives are still on internet. With net neutrality the Internet being a regulated utility the single government would have full power to censor.",democrats
